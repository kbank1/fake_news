    "text=\"US President Donald Trump has offered buyout packages to almost all federal employees, a major move designed to shrink and reform the US government. In an email sent on Tuesday, his administration told workers they had to decide by 6 February whether they wanted to be part of a deferred resignation programme. If they agree by then to quit in September, the message said, they would receive about eight months worth of salary as a severance package. The Trump administration expects up to 10% of employees to accept the offer - which equates to about 200,000 of the more than two million people who work for the federal government, according to the BBCs US partner CBS News. Senior Trump officials told US media that the buyouts could save the government up to $100bn (£80bn). The message from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the governments HR agency, highlighted planned reforms to the government, including a requirement that most employees work in their offices five days a week. Since returning to the White House last week, Trump has already declared the end of Covid-era home working practices. The OPM said the offer was available to all full-time federal employees - excluding certain staff such as postal workers, members of the military, immigration officials, and some national security teams. Workers wishing to take the deal were asked to reply to the email with the word resign in the subject line. The offer includes both pay and benefits for workers until 30 September, and has been described as very generous by the White House. The message also warned of future downsizing that could impact those who chose to stay. We cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency but should your position be eliminated you will be treated with dignity, it read. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, told CNN that the governments workers were overwhelmingly left of centre, and that it was essential for Trump to get control of government. The move has been condemned. In a statement to US media, the head of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union warned that this purging process would have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine was among those questioning Trumps power to make such deals. If you accept that offer and resign, hell stiff you just like he stiffed contractors, he said. He doesnt have any authority to do this. Do not be fooled by this guy. The returning US president repeatedly pledged to cut the size of the government and slash federal spending while on the campaign trail. He tasked Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy with leading an advisory body focused on cutting regulations, spending, and headcounts within the federal government. Ramaswamy has since left this new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). But the email on Tuesday bore resemblance to one sent to employees of Twitter, now X, in late 2022 after Musk bought the social media platform. He asked for an emailed response if they wanted to remain at the company. The mass buyout offer came at the end of an at-times chaotic day in Washington, following a memo Trump issued which said he would pause federal grants, loans and other assistance. A district judge suspended the order - which was initially set to go into effect on Tuesday afternoon - until next Monday. In the hours before that decision, there was widespread confusion over which federal programmes and organisations would be impacted. The White House repeatedly sought to assuage concerns that Social Security payments and Medicaid access could be disrupted.  In a letter to the White House, top Democrats expressed extreme alarm about the plan to pause funding. Also on Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at restricting gender care for young people. The order, titled Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation, says it would prevent those aged under 19 from making life-altering choices. It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called transition of a child from one sex to another, the order said. It is unclear, however, how the order would be implemented and it is likely to be challenged in court.\""

       "'Households will begin the new year with a 5% increase in energy bills after the regulator raised the price cap to an average of £1,928 a year for the typical gas and electricity bill.Ofgem raised the maximum price that energy suppliers can charge their customers from £1,834 a year for the typical household between October to December, after a rise in global gas market prices after the start of the Israel-Hamas war last month.From January to March the price cap will rise to £1,928 a year, which will determine the energy bills for most households.Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said: “This is a difficult time for many people, and any increase in bills will be worrying. But this rise – around the levels we saw in August – is a result of the wholesale cost of gas and electricity rising, which needs to be reflected in the price that we all pay.“It is important that customers are supported and we have made clear to suppliers that we expect them to identify and offer help to those who are struggling with bills.”The regulator set out the price cap rise the day after the Treasury’s autumn statement, which offered a package of tax cuts for companies which plan to make investments. This is expected to be particularly helpful for capital intensive green industries such as solar and offshore wind, which will also benefit from a new exemption from the government’s energy windfall tax.However, consumer campaigners heaped criticism on the Treasury for failing to put forward measures to help hard-pressed households pay their energy bills or insulate their homes.Jess Ralston, the head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a thinktank, said the government should also be spending more on improving home energy efficiency.She said: “Millions of people living in leaky homes are facing a bleak start to 2024 with around £700 extra on bills to heat and power their homes. It didn’t have to be this way. The government has presided over a slowdown in home insulation for struggling households during a gas crisis. The PM’s decision to scrap insulation requirements for landlords means renters are now locked into higher energy bills for years to come. The autumn statement included nothing of note on energy efficiency.”Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow energy security secretary, said: “While the out-of-touch chancellor tried to pretend yesterday that the cost of living crisis was over, these new figures show the truth: energy bills are rising again to an unaffordable level for millions of families.“Despite this, the government has absolutely no plan to get bills down, even admitting that their flagship energy bill will not lower bills by a penny. The Conservatives have no clue how to even try and bring down energy bills for British families.”The Labour party has promised to tighten the UK’s windfall tax on oil and gas giants and use the proceeds to reduce household energy bills. It also plans to accelerate the rollout of clean energy to reduce the UK’s reliance on volatile fossil fuel market prices.Concern over rising energy costs has been compounded by the increase in standing charges, which suppliers add to bills as a flat daily fee, often likened to line rental for a phone, to cover the cost of connecting households to their energy supplier.The energy regulator last week opened a review of standing charges, which for some households have doubled over the past two years. From 1 October the amount these charges add to a typical dual fuel bill rose to above £300 a year – a figure that some argue unfairly penalises low-income households. There was no new increase announced today.'"
