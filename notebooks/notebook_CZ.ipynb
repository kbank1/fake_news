      "Text: Nicki Minaj had an awkward camel toe moment at the BET Awards on June 24 during her performance, however, Drake is here for it! We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why he loves the wardrobe malfunction and her style in general!\n",
      "\n",
      "Drake is Nicki Minaj’s biggest fan! If you keep up with either rapper, you know they have quite a history. From their feud in the past, their rumored romance, Drake’s beef with Nicki’s ex-boyfriend Meek Mill, to their many collaborations including “No Frauds,” it’s clear these two are always going to be in each other’s lives. So, it’s no surprise that when everyone trolled Nicki for her unfortunate wardrobe malfunction at the BET Awards on June 24, Drake would come to her defense. “Drake thinks Nicki’s style and her camel toe are sexy AF. He thinks she is beautiful, talented, and confident enough to rock an outfit even if it highlights her camel toe,” a source close to Drake tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.\n",
      "\n",
      "For those of you who need a refresher, it all happened when Nicki took the stage at the Staples Center to perform “Chun-Li” and “Rich Sex”. However, her red latex body suit was hugging her in all the WRONG places. She even placed her hand over her private area in hopes of hiding it. But, fans were quick to point it out. “When he saw her BET outfit he was majorly turned on. He thought she looked great,” our insider added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Drake thinks Nicki is the only rapper that always looks sexy no matter what she wears. He would still hook-up with Nicki anytime,” the source continued. Talk about determination! “Drake has always felt Nicki was wifey material and her style choices are always sexy,” the source said. We definitely agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past Nicki has denied Drake, but maybe this time things will be different! Plus, she’s single! As many of you may know, she recently got out of a relationship with Nas.\n",

      "Erika Christensen talked about her relationship with Scientology and defended her religion from criticisms from the media, particularly from former co-member Leah Remini.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview with former \"Parenthood\" co-star Dax Shepard's \"Armchair Expert\" podcast on Monday, the 35-year-old star revealed how she became a part of the Church of Scientology. According to the actress, her journey within the religion began with her parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christensen acknowledged how hard it must be for her parents to raise someone as a Scientologist since it is not a belief but a way of life. Her parents just used a parenting approach using the Scientology point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can see that in the way that they approached me as a kid and really tried to do what I'm doing now as a parent, which is trying to temper absolutely necessary discipline and rules and structure with fostering independent thought and freedom of personality. It has to be true for you,\" the actress who is pregnant with her second child with husband Cole Maness stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also said that her parents never obliged her to go to church. Instead, they asked her to research more about Scientology so that she can gauge her feelings about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Shepard asked her why she opted not to watch the critically-acclaimed HBO documentary \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,\" which centered on the lives of the former members of the church as well as their experiences with the religion, the actress said that the statements of the ex-Scientologists are irrelevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actress explained that the documentary has nothing to do with anything that has been thought by the church. She also said that the book where it was based from was not even published in several English-speaking countries since the libel laws in those countries are sterner compared to the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also mentioned that both the documentary, the book, as well as former Scientology member and actress Leah Remini's show \"Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath\" has immaterial sources. \"There's so much that is actually...talking about sources. They have proved themselves to be irrelevant...There's no relevance in what they're saying,\" the actress also stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also revealed that despite the strict rules that are being implemented by the church, Scientology still allows their members to drink alcohol. But she also claimed that doing drugs is definitely prohibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Drinking and drugs and stuff like that, we basically think it's counter-productive,\" she also said in the podcast, as reported by People.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Christensen praised the principles of Scientology, Remini is determined to expose the controversial church's abuses in the third season of her A&E's award-winning series.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview with Deadline during The Contenders Emmy event in May, Remini and her co-host, Mike Rinder, said that they are now looking into the abusive practices of the church now that they are no longer part of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from Christensen and Remini, other popular celebrities who have past and present connection to Scientology include Tom Cruise, Kirstie Alley, Beck, Laura Prepon, Giovanni Ribisi, Kelly Preston, as well as John Travolta.\n",

The actress opened up about her journey into the Church of Scientology, shedding light on her parents' role in introducing her to the religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christensen acknowledged the challenges faced by her parents in raising her within the confines of Scientology, emphasizing that it is not merely a belief system but a complete way of life. She credits her parents with incorporating Scientology principles into their parenting approach, which involved finding a balance between discipline and fostering independent thought.\n",

      "When asked why she chose not to watch the HBO documentary \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,\" which featured former church members sharing their experiences, Christensen dismissed the relevance of such testimonies.

      "Christensen also expressed her view on the immateriality of the sources referenced in the documentary, as well as Leah Remini's show \"Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath\". She stated that their statements have no credibility and do not contribute to a meaningful discussion about Scientology.\n",

The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester currently reside in the 21-bedroom home, which is located right next door to Prince William and Kate, who live in Apartment 1A. According to the annual Sovereign Grant report: \"The existing roof required complete renewal after years of patch repairs, evidence of batten decay and structural defects in some chimneys.\"\\n\\nThe couple are rumoured to move into a new apartment at Kensington Palace\\n\\nIt has been reported that upon announcing their engagement in 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester offered to give up their home and will be moving to the Queen's former secretary's former home, although they remained in the apartment for the 11 months the renovations were taking place and a palace spokesperson confirmed that the pair \"still live in Apartment 1 and that is continuing to be the case\". Princess Michael previously hinted that the apartment will be free for new residents some day, telling Tatler back in 2014 that Prince William and Kate have a \"lovely big apartment, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave their enormous apartment because their children have gone.\"\\n\\nGALLERY: Best photos from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's awards evening with the Queen\\n\\nAdding to speculations that this will be their future home, is the fact that Meghan and Harry have admitted they hope to one day have children.

Speaking about getting to know one another, Harry said: \"We had to sort of reverse the whole process and cosy nights in, in front of the television, cooking dinner with just the two of us by ourselves in our little cottage rather going out for dinner and being seen in public... And has made us a hell of a lot closer in a short space of time.\" The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex also have to option of moving into apartments eight and nine, which were also Harry's childhood home.\\n\\nVIDEO: Prince Harry to the rescue!

According to the annual Sovereign Grant report: \"The existing roof required complete renewal after years of patch repairs, evidence of batten decay and structural defects in some chimneys.\"\\n\\nThe couple are rumoured to move into a new apartment at Kensington Palace\\n\\nIt has been reported that upon announcing their engagement in 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester offered to give up their home and will be moving to the Queen's former secretary's former home, although they remained in the apartment for the 11 months the renovations were taking place and a palace spokesperson confirmed that the pair \"still live in Apartment 1 and that is continuing to be the case\". Princess Michael previously hinted that the apartment will be free for new residents some day, telling Tatler back in 2014 that Prince William and Kate have a \"lovely big apartment, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave their enormous apartment because their children have gone.\"\\n\\nGALLERY: Best photos from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's awards evening with the Queen\\n\\nAdding to speculations that this will be their future home, is the fact that Meghan and Harry have admitted they hope to one day have children. And in that case, they'll need to expand out of the cottage they described as \"little\" in their first televised interview as an engaged couple back in 2017. Speaking about getting to know one another, Harry said: \"We had to sort of reverse the whole process and cosy nights in, in front of the television, cooking dinner with just the two of us by ourselves in our little cottage rather going out for dinner and being seen in public... And has made us a hell of a lot closer in a short space of time.\" The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex also have to option of moving into apartments eight and nine, which were also Harry's childhood home.\\n\\nVIDEO: Prince Harry to the rescue!

      Ben Affleck is keeping life with his three kids and his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus separate, if Jennifer Garner has anything to say about it.\\n\\n“Jen doesn’t want the kids around Lindsay or having her in their lives. She has many reasons,” a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.\\n\\nGarner, 46, and Affleck, 45, who called it quits in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.\\n\\nThough the Batman star officially got together with Shookus, 38, after Garner and Affleck’s filing, a confidant previously confirmed to Us that their relationship started as early as 2014. As a result, the source notes that one of reasons the Love, Simon actress does not want the Saturday Night Live producer around her kids is “the fact that Ben had an affair with her.”\\n\\nHowever, the exes are keeping the peace. According to the insider, “Ben understands and has honored her request.”\\n\\nIn order to view the video, please allow Manage Cookies\\n\\n“They’re good friends,” the source adds. “She wants him to be honest and he usually is. She tends to find out about things, and Ben is very open with her. They both want what’s best for the kids and have made a commitment to see that through.”\\n\\nWhile the estranged couple filed for divorce in 2017, the paperwork has yet to be finalized, partially due to Affleck’s past struggles with alcohol abuse.\\n\\n“The one thing she’s not flexible on is sobriety,” the source tells Us. “Jen is hesitant to sign off until she’s certain that the kids will be in the best hands at all time. Finalizing the divorce has been a long process because of it.”\\n\\nFor more on Garner and Affleck’s post-divorce relationship, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!   \n",

       "      <td>Warning: This story contains major spoilers from a recent episode of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit. Read at your own risk.\\n\\nThe actor joined SVU as Assistant District Attorney Rafael Barba in season 14 in a recurring capacity, before being upped to series regular in season 15.\\n\\nDuring Wednesday's episode, Barba ultimately left the District Attorney's office after pulling the plug on a brain-dead child. Esparza has effectively exited as a series regular, but the door is open for him to return. In his stead, Chicago Justice character Peter Stone (Philip Winchester) has become the new ADA, with Winchester being added to the show as a regular who will likely continue with the show next season should it be renewed.\\n\\n\"It has truly been an honor writing for Raúl,\" SVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin says. \"The power, sensitivity, and morality he brought to the character of Rafael Barba never failed to elevate our scripts. Raúl is family and we look forward to seeing his talent shine in new projects. As for Barba, SVU fans may see him again soon.\"\\n\\nThough SVU has been on for 19 seasons, the show hasn't seen too much turnover in recent years. After Christopher Meloni exited in season 12, fellow originals Richard Belzer and Dann Florek both left in season 15. Danny Pino, who joined the show in season 13, was the show's last big exit back in season 16.\\n\\nFollowing his departure, Esparza is temporarily returning to his Broadway roots for a Chess revival at the Kennedy Center. What's next for him after that? And why did he decide to leave SVU now? Read our full interview to get the scoop:\\n\\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Was it your decision to leave the series?\\n\\nRAUL ESPARZA: Yes.\\n\\nWhy did you decide to leave now?\\n\\nI've done six seasons, I felt like it was time to go. I had explored a lot of what I thought Barba was about. I just felt it was time to move on. I was also feeling like the role has changed over the years in a way that has been an interesting experience for me. Again, I'm a theater guy, so it's like having a script in front of you that keeps changing every time you go to do it. The learning process of how roles grow over a period of time with a series has been kind of fascinating, and I just felt I had reached the end of what I wanted to explore where they were writing.\\n\\nYou were also close with former SVU showrunner Warren Leight, who exited a few seasons back. Was that a factor in your decision to leave?\\n\\nYeah, I think that's pretty much understood. [Laughs]\\n\\nWere you surprised by the way in which Barba exited the series?\\n\\nYeah, it wasn't really a way that I figured that he would go out. But I do have to say that when we worked on the script, it was pretty extraordinary. I don't watch myself, so I haven't seen the episode, but putting it together was a really great experience. It's one of those things that you just learn as you go, what a script really is, and it was a surprising one. I think that [current showrunner] Michael Chernuchin has done some really beautiful writing for Barba this season, in a way that's like a really beautiful gift that got handed to me. Because I had decided to leave at the beginning of the season before he came in, and then they hand me this beautiful gift with some really gorgeous writing from a new showrunner, who has really taken care of me this year. And this particular script was something very dear to him. As we began to do it I started to find that it was challenging, and emotional, and surprising, and not at all what I expected from having just read it on the page.\\n\\nWere there alternate ways in which Barba could leave, like him dying?\\n\\nI'll say that the one thing we talked about is he absolutely doesn't need to die because it's not like I'm leaving on bad terms. I think that Barba's become a part of the SVU family, and I think there's a life for him—I don't know necessarily, but it's possible that there's a life for him as the series goes on. I'm glad they left that door open.\\n\\nWould you be interested in returning to SVU in the future?\\n\\nAbsolutely, because I'm really rooting for the opportunity to make television history with the series. I'd be lying if I didn't say that's part of what we all hope for, that NBC manages in the end to get a record-breaking series on its hands with potential 21 years. Also, this doesn't always happen when you work with people, but I became friends with Mariska [Hargitay] and she's part of my life now. I don't just miss the role, I miss her, so any opportunity to get back into a room with her is valuable to me. Part of the reason I became Barba, and that it turned into the show that it did for me, was the way I hit it off with her and that was surprising. What was supposed to be a guest-starring spot that Warren had written for me morphed into something very rich and surprising, and I really am not blowing smoke when I say it's entirely because of the space that was created between me and Mariska. It's chemistry—it happens or doesn't, and it happened.\\n\\nIt almost seemed like there was a potential for romance between Barba and Benson. Did you ever think the show would go that route?\\n\\nNo, I didn't, honestly, because they are both workaholics. I was never really interested in exploring his private life as much in terms of feeling like he's a man who has given up on relationships in order to succeed. His ambition has driven him. Maybe that's making an excuse for what they do or don't write on shows like Law &amp; Order, but Benson's life is a much more complicated situation. I always thought it would remove a layer of excitement and friction and sexiness between us if we ever went in that direction. I really thought that would just state the obvious instead of letting it just simmer, which one of the rules of good television is keep them wanting—never have successful relationships and keep them wanting the one that you really wish would happen.\\n\\nIs there anything you wish you got to do with Barba that you didn't get a chance to?\\n\\nHonestly, no. If the show had been a different kind of show, it'd be fun to spin into the political world of what the DAs office is all about, but that's not really what Law &amp; Order: SVU is about. When they do the Barba spin-off, maybe we can go in that direction, right? [Laughs] I think New York politics in the mayor's office and with the district attorney's office is fascinating, but that would be a different world. That's the only thing we glanced at, but never really got into it. Other than that, I feel like Barba turned out to be both a showman and someone who slowly reined in his ambition to become a truly top-notch prosecutor. His intelligence was ferocious, his turn-of-phrase and the ways that Benson changed him were apparent to me season by season, and the ways that he changed her were also really alive for me. So that's pretty rich stuff to get to play with.\\n\\nLaw &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - Season 19 Credit: Michael Parmelee/NBC\\n\\nWhat was it like having Sam Waterston and Philip Winchester come in for your final episode?\\n\\nIt was ridiculous. First of all, Philip is one of the coolest, nicest guys I've gotten the opportunity to work with and welcoming him to SVU-land was pretty wonderful. For years, long before I had anything to do with Law &amp; Order, Sam Waterston's performance as Jack McCoy is one of the great TV performances. I feel like it was a benchmark for me of excellence in what you could do in a procedural with material that didn't reveal a great deal about a character except for what they did, and he revealed an entire life and an entire person for so many years. I think Sam's a truly great actor, so he paid me an enormous compliment by coming in to see Barba off. It was a little bit of a passing of a baton, but also an opportunity for me to have what felt like a total career highlight. And I'm not making that up, it was thrilling that time I got to spend with him—for the admiration, for the role, and for him in it and just to have his presence there. Even though we are on the series, you still get a little bit starstruck when some of the main people from the first show, show up. You just do. It's a little like, \"Oh yeah, wow, because I've been watching you since I was whatever age.\"\\n\\nAs you're in the middle of rehearsals for Chess right now, was getting back into the world of Broadway a priority for you?\\n\\nI mean, I miss it. There's this amazing concert, we're doing the musical Chess, which has not had a Broadway revival in 30 years, and so we're looking at it and have been working on it. It's just really a ferociously cool cast and we started reading it last summer, and we are going to do it at the Kennedy Center concert next week. So that's what I'm doing and beyond that, I have no sense of what the Broadway world holds. It's part of my career and of course, I miss it because I miss the relationship to the audience. I love being on stage, but I would be lying if I didn't say that doing SVU and then doing Hannibal at the same time, and doing the kind of work that I've been doing for the last few years, hasn't been a total amazing head rush. There is something to be missed of a live performance, but this is a whole new world that I am really thrilled to be a part of, and I don't plan on leaving it. This season, I'm playing a professor on The Path for Hulu, and that was a fantastic arc to be part of and work with Michelle Monaghan, Aaron [Paul], and Hugh [Dancy], who I worked with on Hannibal. To go back and forth between that and SVU this year was thrilling, and also seeing the ways that television is being made, the differences between the ways that shows are made, and learning in every cast that I'm part of how the whole experience comes together. I still feel like a newbie at this.\\n\\nI look back at some of my episodes when I first started: I'm not bad, I'm good, that's great. But then I see stuff now and I'm like, holy sh--, I've learned so much about how to do this thing. The relationship with the camera, the camera can read your mind. There's no audience in any theater that can do what a camera can do. Let's not kid ourselves, on Broadway—well, maybe not right now, I mean with the way that social media has changed some of the things that happen on stage—but for the most part, you're famous in a 10-block radius. What a television series does is put you in people's homes all over the world. It just completely transforms how far your acting can go and who it reaches. I am most grateful for the opportunity of rounding out my career. It was a big theater career, and now I've been able to do these other projects. I mean, just last season—I was thinking about it before we started this interview—Bojack Horseman, Ferdinand, which I can't believe they got nominated for an Oscar for that, and then the work on The Path and the work on SVU, and now working on a Broadway musical, it's pretty thrilling.\\n\\nAny dream shows you would want to appear on?\\n\\nRight now, I'm kind of obsessing over The Crown. And who doesn't want to be on Game of Thrones, honestly? But for years, my go-to was, \"I just want to be a zombie on The Walking Dead.\" [Laughs] Oh yeah, especially as soon as Danai [Gurira] joined, because Danai and I were in a film for Wes Craven many years ago, and as soon as she was on it, I was like, \"Oh come on, I just wanna be there, just be like King Zombie, just one episode.\" It's hard to watch television when you're making television. I've been catching up on some shows, and right now I'm currently obsessing about The Crown. I think it's some of the best acting I've seen on TV. I'm like, \"Huh, I wonder if there's a role I can play there?\"\\n\\nLaw &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.</td>\n",

The rapper’s death was ruled as accidental by the medical examiner.\\n\\nTMZ reports that a cocktail of other drugs were also found in his system. His blood tested positive for marijuana, cocaine and the painkiller Tramadol, and his urine tested positive for those drugs, as well as opiates such as hydrocodone, generic Dilauded, oxycodone and oxymorphone. The medical examiner did not find alcohol in his system.\\n\\nPeep, whose real name was Gustav Åhr, died last month in Tucson, Arizona, where he was supposed to hold a concert in support of his debut album, Come Over When You’re Sober (Part One). He was 21. Local authorities speculated that the circumstances around the rapper’s death were “suspicious,” though at the time the Tucson police department was under the assumption his death was caused by a combination of Xanax and other drugs.\\n\\nThe authorities said they were investigating text messages sent by a woman who’d visited Peep’s tour bus before his death. “GBC [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol,” read one allegedly. Another supposedly read, “He passed the fuck out my brother called and I tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up.”\\n\\nA memorial for the rapper, who blended hip-hop with guitar-driven emo, was recently held in Long Beach, New York, featuring speakers and a public gathering.\\n\\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, the rapper said he never took prescriptions for depression but enjoyed taking drugs. “I just like smoking weed and whatever other drug comes my way,” He said. “I don’t like to pay for [drugs].

       "      <td>Goop is kicking off its weekly podcast in a big way. Oprah big. Oprah Winfrey is Goop’s inaugural guest on its podcast, hosted by founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and the hour-plus conversation touches on everything Oprah, from her decades as an inimitable television host to her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her ultimate hope for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations, or lack thereof.\\n\\nWinfrey said she was friendly with Weinstein in a professional capacity from the days of her eponymous talk show, but addressed accusations that she must have known of his allegedly long history of sexually predatory behavior toward female actors and other women, saying she simply had no idea and wasn’t really in that world of entertainment. But she did know that everyone dreaded getting a call from him.\\n\\n“I was in Chicago, in my own little world, but what I knew about Harvey was that Harvey was a bully and that if Harvey’s on the phone, you didn’t want to take the call because you’re going to get bullied in some way,” Winfrey said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile for her a call from Weinstein generally meant being pressured, in a way left undefined, to have certain people on her show, now Winfrey is left wondering why she even let herself be bullied at all.\\n\\n“What I do question for myself is why I was willing to put up with a bullying thing?” Winfrey said. “I was willing to put up with, ‘OK I’ll take the call,’ ‘OK I’ll do that’…why am I willing to put up with an a–hole? Why we won’t tolerate other things, but you can throw phones and call people jerks or whatever and do all this nasty stuff.”\\n\\nAs for why Weinstein’s alleged behavior was a watershed for the long-normalized harassment and sexual abuse of women, despite many previous public allegations against not only Weinstein but other high-profile men, Winfrey thinks it’s something akin to critical mass.\\n\\n“It had been coming, it had been coming,” Winfrey said. “It had been coming with [Bill] Cosby and nothing happened, it had been coming with Bill O’Reilly, even with the President of the United States, where people can hear the Access Hollywood tape and yet, nothing happens. It had been coming and [Weinstein] was the moment was where it all crystallized.…In order for a phenomenon to be a phenomenon everything has to line up. It means the culture, the zeitgeist, for a particular moment in time to be ready, available and open to hear that message.”\\n\\nThe idea that these issues and women’s experiences with abuse and harassment have been building up in the culture for so long, with most women throughout history being unable to speak up because it would likely have meant further harm to them and their families, was what Winfrey was trying to get across in her acceptance speech at this year’s Golden Globes — not a political platform.\\n\\n“I wasn’t trying to run for any office,” Winfrey said of the speech. “I wanted to be able to say to the #MeToo movement, I’m proud of where we are and what we’re doing, but you need to know you didn’t get here alone. There are those who endured, suffered and didn’t speak because they couldn’t speak.”\\n\\nWinfrey slipped back into her role of interviewer and asked Paltrow if her decision to go public last fall with her own Weinstein story — wherein the producer got her as a relatively unestablished young actor to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and proceeded to unabashedly proposition her and then berate her for confiding in family and friends about the episode — was triggered by the then few other stories that had come out about him.\\n\\n“Very, and it’s been months of me trying to process through it all,” Paltrow, who worked with Weinstein several times after the incident, said. “It only happened one time and I confronted him and he never tried anything like that again, but he was [always] a bully about work things, he was shaming, he was really hard on me and then was incredibly generous and would send me a private plane somewhere. It was a kind of typical abusive relationship and I hadn’t processed it, because so much of my acting career and so many of the incredible highs and lows, as well, were associated with him and Miramax.”\\n\\nPaltrow added that the experience of going public has “brought up a lot of stuff lately” including abuse from her childhood, a topic that Winfrey spoke of her own experiences with during the podcast, and said she’s recently begun to question whether her decision to mostly leave acting when she had her first child was actually related to her experiences with Weinstein.\\n\\n“I always told myself the story that I’d lost the passion for it and then I had my daughter and I wanted to be home and now I’m starting to put the pieces together and thinking did this predominate relationship in my professional life lead me to not want to do it anymore?”\\n\\nWinfrey said that so many negative experiences with Weinstein “certainly had an influence” but also admitted that her hope for the #MeToo movement goes beyond women’s rights, and that it continues to facilitate what she and Paltrow agreed has become “a culture of enough.”\\n\\n“I’m hoping that it leads to a better way of all human beings treating each other and that this moment in the movement is leading to us toward saying, ‘Not only am I not going to take your sexual harassment, I’m not going to take any of your bulls–t.’ Period. I think we’re on our way but we’re still figuring it out.”</td>\n",

       "2  Warning: This story contains major spoilers from a recent episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Read at your own risk.\\n\\nThe actor joined SVU as Assistant District Attorney Rafael Barba in season 14 in a recurring capacity, before being upped to series regular in season 15.\\n\\nDuring Wednesday's episode, Barba ultimately left the District Attorney's office after pulling the plug on a brain-dead child. Esparza has effectively exited as a series regular, but the door is open for him to return. In his stead, Chicago Justice character Peter Stone (Philip Winchester) has become the new ADA, with Winchester being added to the show as a regular who will likely continue with the show next season should it be renewed.\\n\\n\"It has truly been an honor writing for Raúl,\" SVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin says. \"The power, sensitivity, and morality he brought to the character of Rafael Barba never failed to elevate our scripts. Raúl is family and we look forward to seeing his talent shine in new projects. As for Barba, SVU fans may see him again soon.\"\\n\\nThough SVU has been on for 19 seasons, the show hasn't seen too much turnover in recent years. After Christopher Meloni exited in season 12, fellow originals Richard Belzer and Dann Florek both left in season 15. Danny Pino, who joined the show in season 13, was the show's last big exit back in season 16.\\n\\nFollowing his departure, Esparza is temporarily returning to his Broadway roots for a Chess revival at the Kennedy Center. What's next for him after that? And why did he decide to leave SVU now? Read our full interview to get the scoop:\\n\\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Was it your decision to leave the series?\\n\\nRAUL ESPARZA: Yes.\\n\\nWhy did you decide to leave now?\\n\\nI've done six seasons, I felt like it was time to go. I had explored a lot of what I thought Barba was about. I just felt it was time to move on. I was also feeling like the role has changed over the years in a way that has been an interesting experience for me. Again, I'm a theater guy, so it's like having a script in front of you that keeps changing every time you go to do it. The learning process of how roles grow over a period of time with a series has been kind of fascinating, and I just felt I had reached the end of what I wanted to explore where they were writing.\\n\\nYou were also close with former SVU showrunner Warren Leight, who exited a few seasons back. Was that a factor in your decision to leave?\\n\\nYeah, I think that's pretty much understood. [Laughs]\\n\\nWere you surprised by the way in which Barba exited the series?\\n\\nYeah, it wasn't really a way that I figured that he would go out. But I do have to say that when we worked on the script, it was pretty extraordinary. I don't watch myself, so I haven't seen the episode, but putting it together was a really great experience. It's one of those things that you just learn as you go, what a script really is, and it was a surprising one. I think that [current showrunner] Michael Chernuchin has done some really beautiful writing for Barba this season, in a way that's like a really beautiful gift that got handed to me. Because I had decided to leave at the beginning of the season before he came in, and then they hand me this beautiful gift with some really gorgeous writing from a new showrunner, who has really taken care of me this year. And this particular script was something very dear to him. As we began to do it I started to find that it was challenging, and emotional, and surprising, and not at all what I expected from having just read it on the page.\\n\\nWere there alternate ways in which Barba could leave, like him dying?\\n\\nI'll say that the one thing we talked about is he absolutely doesn't need to die because it's not like I'm leaving on bad terms. I think that Barba's become a part of the SVU family, and I think there's a life for him—I don't know necessarily, but it's possible that there's a life for him as the series goes on. I'm glad they left that door open.\\n\\nWould you be interested in returning to SVU in the future?\\n\\nAbsolutely, because I'm really rooting for the opportunity to make television history with the series. I'd be lying if I didn't say that's part of what we all hope for, that NBC manages in the end to get a record-breaking series on its hands with potential 21 years. Also, this doesn't always happen when you work with people, but I became friends with Mariska [Hargitay] and she's part of my life now. I don't just miss the role, I miss her, so any opportunity to get back into a room with her is valuable to me. Part of the reason I became Barba, and that it turned into the show that it did for me, was the way I hit it off with her and that was surprising. What was supposed to be a guest-starring spot that Warren had written for me morphed into something very rich and surprising, and I really am not blowing smoke when I say it's entirely because of the space that was created between me and Mariska. It's chemistry—it happens or doesn't, and it happened.\\n\\nIt almost seemed like there was a potential for romance between Barba and Benson. Did you ever think the show would go that route?\\n\\nNo, I didn't, honestly, because they are both workaholics. I was never really interested in exploring his private life as much in terms of feeling like he's a man who has given up on relationships in order to succeed. His ambition has driven him. Maybe that's making an excuse for what they do or don't write on shows like Law & Order, but Benson's life is a much more complicated situation. I always thought it would remove a layer of excitement and friction and sexiness between us if we ever went in that direction. I really thought that would just state the obvious instead of letting it just simmer, which one of the rules of good television is keep them wanting—never have successful relationships and keep them wanting the one that you really wish would happen.\\n\\nIs there anything you wish you got to do with Barba that you didn't get a chance to?\\n\\nHonestly, no. If the show had been a different kind of show, it'd be fun to spin into the political world of what the DAs office is all about, but that's not really what Law & Order: SVU is about. When they do the Barba spin-off, maybe we can go in that direction, right? [Laughs] I think New York politics in the mayor's office and with the district attorney's office is fascinating, but that would be a different world. That's the only thing we glanced at, but never really got into it. Other than that, I feel like Barba turned out to be both a showman and someone who slowly reined in his ambition to become a truly top-notch prosecutor. His intelligence was ferocious, his turn-of-phrase and the ways that Benson changed him were apparent to me season by season, and the ways that he changed her were also really alive for me. So that's pretty rich stuff to get to play with.\\n\\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit - Season 19 Credit: Michael Parmelee/NBC\\n\\nWhat was it like having Sam Waterston and Philip Winchester come in for your final episode?\\n\\nIt was ridiculous. First of all, Philip is one of the coolest, nicest guys I've gotten the opportunity to work with and welcoming him to SVU-land was pretty wonderful. For years, long before I had anything to do with Law & Order, Sam Waterston's performance as Jack McCoy is one of the great TV performances. I feel like it was a benchmark for me of excellence in what you could do in a procedural with material that didn't reveal a great deal about a character except for what they did, and he revealed an entire life and an entire person for so many years. I think Sam's a truly great actor, so he paid me an enormous compliment by coming in to see Barba off. It was a little bit of a passing of a baton, but also an opportunity for me to have what felt like a total career highlight. And I'm not making that up, it was thrilling that time I got to spend with him—for the admiration, for the role, and for him in it and just to have his presence there. Even though we are on the series, you still get a little bit starstruck when some of the main people from the first show, show up. You just do. It's a little like, \"Oh yeah, wow, because I've been watching you since I was whatever age.\"\\n\\nAs you're in the middle of rehearsals for Chess right now, was getting back into the world of Broadway a priority for you?\\n\\nI mean, I miss it. There's this amazing concert, we're doing the musical Chess, which has not had a Broadway revival in 30 years, and so we're looking at it and have been working on it. It's just really a ferociously cool cast and we started reading it last summer, and we are going to do it at the Kennedy Center concert next week. So that's what I'm doing and beyond that, I have no sense of what the Broadway world holds. It's part of my career and of course, I miss it because I miss the relationship to the audience. I love being on stage, but I would be lying if I didn't say that doing SVU and then doing Hannibal at the same time, and doing the kind of work that I've been doing for the last few years, hasn't been a total amazing head rush. There is something to be missed of a live performance, but this is a whole new world that I am really thrilled to be a part of, and I don't plan on leaving it. This season, I'm playing a professor on The Path for Hulu, and that was a fantastic arc to be part of and work with Michelle Monaghan, Aaron [Paul], and Hugh [Dancy], who I worked with on Hannibal. To go back and forth between that and SVU this year was thrilling, and also seeing the ways that television is being made, the differences between the ways that shows are made, and learning in every cast that I'm part of how the whole experience comes together. I still feel like a newbie at this.\\n\\nI look back at some of my episodes when I first started: I'm not bad, I'm good, that's great. But then I see stuff now and I'm like, holy sh--, I've learned so much about how to do this thing. The relationship with the camera, the camera can read your mind. There's no audience in any theater that can do what a camera can do. Let's not kid ourselves, on Broadway—well, maybe not right now, I mean with the way that social media has changed some of the things that happen on stage—but for the most part, you're famous in a 10-block radius. What a television series does is put you in people's homes all over the world. It just completely transforms how far your acting can go and who it reaches. I am most grateful for the opportunity of rounding out my career. It was a big theater career, and now I've been able to do these other projects. I mean, just last season—I was thinking about it before we started this interview—Bojack Horseman, Ferdinand, which I can't believe they got nominated for an Oscar for that, and then the work on The Path and the work on SVU, and now working on a Broadway musical, it's pretty thrilling.\\n\\nAny dream shows you would want to appear on?\\n\\nRight now, I'm kind of obsessing over The Crown. And who doesn't want to be on Game of Thrones, honestly? But for years, my go-to was, \"I just want to be a zombie on The Walking Dead.\" [Laughs] Oh yeah, especially as soon as Danai [Gurira] joined, because Danai and I were in a film for Wes Craven many years ago, and as soon as she was on it, I was like, \"Oh come on, I just wanna be there, just be like King Zombie, just one episode.\" It's hard to watch television when you're making television. I've been catching up on some shows, and right now I'm currently obsessing about The Crown. I think it's some of the best acting I've seen on TV. I'm like, \"Huh, I wonder if there's a role I can play there?\"\\n\\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.   \n",

         Lil Peep died of an overdose of fentanyl and generic Xanax, according to the Pima Country Office of the Medical Examiner. The rapper’s death was ruled as accidental by the medical examiner.\\n\\nTMZ reports that a cocktail of other drugs were also found in his system. His blood tested positive for marijuana, cocaine and the painkiller Tramadol, and his urine tested positive for those drugs, as well as opiates such as hydrocodone, generic Dilauded, oxycodone and oxymorphone. The medical examiner did not find alcohol in his system.\\n\\nPeep, whose real name was Gustav Åhr, died last month in Tucson, Arizona, where he was supposed to hold a concert in support of his debut album, Come Over When You’re Sober (Part One). He was 21. Local authorities speculated that the circumstances around the rapper’s death were “suspicious,” though at the time the Tucson police department was under the assumption his death was caused by a combination of Xanax and other drugs.\\n\\nThe authorities said they were investigating text messages sent by a woman who’d visited Peep’s tour bus before his death. “GBC [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol,” read one allegedly. Another supposedly read, “He passed the fuck out my brother called and I tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up.”\\n\\nA memorial for the rapper, who blended hip-hop with guitar-driven emo, was recently held in Long Beach, New York, featuring speakers and a public gathering.\\n\\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, the rapper said he never took prescriptions for depression but enjoyed taking drugs. “I just like smoking weed and whatever other drug comes my way,” He said. “I don’t like to pay for [drugs]. I just like to get them for free.”   \n",

Oprah big. Oprah Winfrey is Goop’s inaugural guest on its podcast, hosted by founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and the hour-plus conversation touches on everything Oprah, from her decades as an inimitable television host to her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her ultimate hope for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations, or lack thereof.\\n\\nWinfrey said she was friendly with Weinstein in a professional capacity from the days of her eponymous talk show, but addressed accusations that she must have known of his allegedly long history of sexually predatory behavior toward female actors and other women, saying she simply had no idea and wasn’t really in that world of entertainment. But she did know that everyone dreaded getting a call from him.\\n\\n“I was in Chicago, in my own little world, but what I knew about Harvey was that Harvey was a bully and that if Harvey’s on the phone, you didn’t want to take the call because you’re going to get bullied in some way,” Winfrey said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile for her a call from Weinstein generally meant being pressured, in a way left undefined, to have certain people on her show, now Winfrey is left wondering why she even let herself be bullied at all.\\n\\n“What I do question for myself is why I was willing to put up with a bullying thing?” Winfrey said. “I was willing to put up with, ‘OK I’ll take the call,’ ‘OK I’ll do that’…why am I willing to put up with an a–hole? Why we won’t tolerate other things, but you can throw phones and call people jerks or whatever and do all this nasty stuff.”\\n\\nAs for why Weinstein’s alleged behavior was a watershed for the long-normalized harassment and sexual abuse of women, despite many previous public allegations against not only Weinstein but other high-profile men, Winfrey thinks it’s something akin to critical mass.\\n\\n“It had been coming, it had been coming,” Winfrey said. “It had been coming with [Bill] Cosby and nothing happened, it had been coming with Bill O’Reilly, even with the President of the United States, where people can hear the Access Hollywood tape and yet, nothing happens. It had been coming and [Weinstein] was the moment was where it all crystallized.…In order for a phenomenon to be a phenomenon everything has to line up. It means the culture, the zeitgeist, for a particular moment in time to be ready, available and open to hear that message.”\\n\\nThe idea that these issues and women’s experiences with abuse and harassment have been building up in the culture for so long, with most women throughout history being unable to speak up because it would likely have meant further harm to them and their families, was what Winfrey was trying to get across in her acceptance speech at this year’s Golden Globes — not a political platform.\\n\\n“I wasn’t trying to run for any office,” Winfrey said of the speech. “I wanted to be able to say to the #MeToo movement, I’m proud of where we are and what we’re doing, but you need to know you didn’t get here alone. There are those who endured, suffered and didn’t speak because they couldn’t speak.”\\n\\nWinfrey slipped back into her role of interviewer and asked Paltrow if her decision to go public last fall with her own Weinstein story — wherein the producer got her as a relatively unestablished young actor to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and proceeded to unabashedly proposition her and then berate her for confiding in family and friends about the episode — was triggered by the then few other stories that had come out about him.\\n\\n“Very, and it’s been months of me trying to process through it all,” Paltrow, who worked with Weinstein several times after the incident, said. “It only happened one time and I confronted him and he never tried anything like that again, but he was [always] a bully about work things, he was shaming, he was really hard on me and then was incredibly generous and would send me a private plane somewhere. It was a kind of typical abusive relationship and I hadn’t processed it, because so much of my acting career and so many of the incredible highs and lows, as well, were associated with him and Miramax.”\\n\\nPaltrow added that the experience of going public has “brought up a lot of stuff lately” including abuse from her childhood, a topic that Winfrey spoke of her own experiences with during the podcast, and said she’s recently begun to question whether her decision to mostly leave acting when she had her first child was actually related to her experiences with Weinstein.\\n\\n“I always told myself the story that I’d lost the passion for it and then I had my daughter and I wanted to be home and now I’m starting to put the pieces together and thinking did this predominate relationship in my professional life lead me to not want to do it anymore?”\\n\\nWinfrey said that so many negative experiences with Weinstein “certainly had an influence” but also admitted that her hope for the #MeToo movement goes beyond women’s rights, and that it continues to facilitate what she and Paltrow agreed has become “a culture of enough.”\\n\\n“I’m hoping that it leads to a better way of all human beings treating each other and that this moment in the movement is leading to us toward saying, ‘Not only am I not going to take your sexual harassment, I’m not going to take any of your bulls–t.’ Period. I think we’re on our way but we’re still figuring it out.”   \n",

Prince Harry has finally proposed to his girlfriend Meghan Markle and the couple is set to tie the knot in the spring of 2018. \\n\\nSpeculations have been swirling for months that the couple was planning to get engaged, and today the news has finally been confirmed. The public has fallen in love with the American actress and her fashion sense, down-to-earth personality, and charitable works. The Royal Family, too, is reportedly ecstatic about the prospect of having such a \"modern\" bride.\\n\\nMany pundits have praised Prince Harry for choosing someone outside of the typical royal circles, and believe that Meghan Markle brings much-needed diversity to the monarchy. Markle is of mixed race, divorced, and a successful actress in her own right. Her engagement to Prince Harry is already being hailed as a critical moment in royal history.\\n\\nRumor has it that the wedding preparations are already underway, and that the couple is determined to make their big day a memorable one. There are already some reports that they plan to buck tradition when it comes to everything from the guest list to the style of dress. However, the Royal Family has been tight-lipped about any details.\\n\\nOne thing is for certain: the world will be watching as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle exchange their vows in spring 2018. The couple has already won the hearts of millions around the globe, and their wedding is shaping up to be a \"can't miss\" event. Stay tuned for more updates as the big day approaches!   \n",

However, the news of this installation has sparked outrage amongst their fans.\\n\\nMany fans have taken to social media to express their anger and disappointment in the couple's decision, claiming that it perpetuates a culture of fear and paranoia. \"It's ridiculous that they feel the need to have a panic room in their already secure and gated home,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"It's a slap in the face to those who don't even have basic safety provisions.\"\\n\\nOthers have called out the couple for prioritizing their own safety over the safety of their fans. \"Kim and Kanye have plenty of money and resources to keep themselves safe,\" another user tweeted. \"But what about the safety of their fans who support them and look up to them?\"\\n\\nDespite the backlash, Kim and Kanye remain firm in their decision and have emphasized that the panic room is a necessary precaution to ensure the safety of their family. However, it remains to be seen how this will affect their public image and relationship with their fans.   \n",

A source close to the situation reveals that Garner \"doesn't want\" her three kids with ex-husband Ben Affleck around his new girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus.\\n\\nThe source further disclosed that Garner has made her feelings towards Shookus very clear and has even gone so far as to ban her from coming near their kids. \"Jennifer has always been very protective of Violet, Seraphina and Samuel and she doesn't trust Lindsay around them,\" the source added.\\n\\nWhile Garner has not publicly commented on the matter, it's no secret that she and Affleck's relationship has been anything but amicable. Despite their split in 2015, the pair have remained co-parents, however, their relationship has been plagued with rumors of Affleck's cheating and addiction issues.\\n\\nGarner's recent action is sure to raise a stir in the media and among Affleck and Shookus' fans. However, the source emphasized that Garner was \"just being a protective mother and has nothing against Lindsay personally.\"\\n\\nAs the story continues to develop, it remains to be seen whether Affleck will take any action against Garner's decision or whether the couple will finally be able to work together for the sake of their children.   \n",

       "      <td>Warning: This story contains major spoilers from a recent episode of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit. Read at your own risk.\\n\\nRaúl Esparza has officially exited Law &amp; Order: SVU after six seasons. The actor joined the show in season 14 as Assistant District Attorney Rafael Barba in a recurring capacity before being promoted to series regular in season 15.\\n\\nIn a recent episode, Barba made the difficult decision to pull the plug on a brain-dead child, leading to his departure from the District Attorney's office. Although Esparza has left the series as a regular, there is a possibility for him to return in the future. Chicago Justice character Peter Stone, played by Philip Winchester, has now taken over as the new ADA and is expected to continue with the show if it gets renewed for another season.\\n\\nSVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin expressed his admiration for Esparza's performance, saying, \"The power, sensitivity, and morality he brought to the character of Rafael Barba never failed to elevate our scripts. Raúl is family, and we look forward to seeing his talent shine in new projects. As for Barba, SVU fans may see him again soon.\"\\n\\nWhile SVU has been on the air for 19 seasons, the show has not experienced much turnover in recent years. Esparza's exit marks a significant departure from the series, following the departures of other original cast members like Christopher Meloni, Richard Belzer, Dann Florek, and Danny Pino.\\n\\nFollowing his departure from SVU, Esparza will temporarily return to his Broadway roots for a Chess revival at the Kennedy Center. It remains unclear what projects he will take on after that.\\n\\nIn an interview, Esparza revealed that leaving SVU was his decision after six seasons. He explained, \"I had explored a lot of what I thought Barba was about, and I just felt it was time to move on. I was also feeling like the role has changed over the years in a way that has been an interesting experience for me.\"\\n\\nEsparza also expressed his fondness for his co-star Mariska Hargitay and his desire to work with her again, saying, \"Any opportunity to get back into a room with her is valuable to me.\"\\n\\nAlthough there were hints of a potential romance between Barba and Hargitay's character, Benson, Esparza believed that exploring their private lives would remove the excitement and allure of their relationship.\\n\\nEsparza shared that he felt satisfied with the development of his character, Barba, during his time on the show. However, he did mention that if a Barba spin-off were to explore the political world of the District Attorney's office, he would be interested in delving into that storyline.\\n\\nEsparza expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to work on SVU and praised the experience of working in television. He also mentioned his admiration for shows like The Crown and Game of Thrones, revealing his dream to appear on them in the future.\\n\\nFans of Law &amp; Order: SVU can catch the show on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner has confirmed that rapper Lil Peep died of an overdose of fentanyl and generic Xanax. The medical examiner ruled his death as accidental.\\n\\nAccording to TMZ, a mixture of other drugs was also found in Lil Peep's system. His blood tested positive for marijuana, cocaine, and the painkiller Tramadol, while his urine tested positive for those drugs as well as opiates like hydrocodone, generic Dilauded, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. However, no traces of alcohol were detected.\\n\\nLil Peep, born Gustav Åhr, passed away last month at the age of 21 in Tucson, Arizona, where he was scheduled to perform a concert in support of his debut album, \"Come Over When You’re Sober (Part One)\". Although local authorities initially considered his death to be \"suspicious,\" the Tucson police department had previously speculated that it resulted from a combination of Xanax and other drugs.\\n\\nAuthorities are currently investigating text messages sent by a woman who had visited Lil Peep's tour bus before his demise. Allegedly, one of the messages read, \"GBC [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol,\" while another supposedly stated, \"He passed the fuck out my brother called, and I tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up.\"\\n\\nRecently, a memorial was held in Long Beach, New York, to honor the rapper, known for his unique blend of hip-hop and guitar-driven emo. The memorial featured speakers and a public gathering.\\n\\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, Lil Peep had previously shared that he never took prescriptions for depression but enjoyed indulging in drugs. He stated, \"I just like smoking weed and whatever other drug comes my way. I don't like to pay for [drugs]. I just like to get them for free.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gwyneth Paltrow, Oprah Discuss Weinstein and #MeToo Movement's Future on Goop Podcast</td>\n",
       "      <td>Goop is kicking off its weekly podcast in a big way. Oprah Winfrey is Goop’s inaugural guest on its podcast, hosted by founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and the hour-plus conversation touches on everything Oprah, from her decades as an inimitable television host to her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her ultimate hope for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations, or lack thereof.\\n\\nWinfrey said she was friendly with Weinstein in a professional capacity from the days of her eponymous talk show, but addressed accusations that she must have known of his allegedly long history of sexually predatory behavior toward female actors and other women, saying she simply had no idea and wasn’t really in that world of entertainment. But she did know that everyone dreaded getting a call from him.\\n\\n“I was in Chicago, in my own little world, but what I knew about Harvey was that Harvey was a bully and that if Harvey’s on the phone, you didn’t want to take the call because you’re going to get bullied in some way,” Winfrey said.\\n\\nWhile for her a call from Weinstein generally meant being pressured, in a way left undefined, to have certain people on her show, now Winfrey is left wondering why she even let herself be bullied at all.\\n\\n“What I do question for myself is why I was willing to put up with a bullying thing?” Winfrey said. “I was willing to put up with, ‘OK I’ll take the call,’ ‘OK I’ll do that’…why am I willing to put up with an a–hole? Why we won’t tolerate other things, but you can throw phones and call people jerks or whatever and do all this nasty stuff.”\\n\\nAs for why Weinstein’s alleged behavior was a watershed for the long-normalized harassment and sexual abuse of women, despite many previous public allegations against not only Weinstein but other high-profile men, Winfrey thinks it’s something akin to critical mass.\\n\\n“It had been coming, it had been coming,” Winfrey said. “It had been coming with [Bill] Cosby and nothing happened, it had been coming with Bill O’Reilly, even with the President of the United States, where people can hear the Access Hollywood tape and yet, nothing happens. It had been coming and [Weinstein] was the moment was where it all crystallized.…In order for a phenomenon to be a phenomenon everything has to line up. It means the culture, the zeitgeist, for a particular moment in time to be ready, available and open to hear that message.”\\n\\nThe idea that these issues and women’s experiences with abuse and harassment have been building up in the culture for so long, with most women throughout history being unable to speak up because it would likely have meant further harm to them and their families, was what Winfrey was trying to get across in her acceptance speech at this year’s Golden Globes — not a political platform.\\n\\n“I wasn’t trying to run for any office,” Winfrey said of the speech. “I wanted to be able to say to the #MeToo movement, I’m proud of where we are and what we’re doing, but you need to know you didn’t get here alone. There are those who endured, suffered and didn’t speak because they couldn’t speak.”\\n\\nWinfrey slipped back into her role of interviewer and asked Paltrow if her decision to go public last fall with her own Weinstein story — wherein the producer got her as a relatively unestablished young actor to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and proceeded to unabashedly proposition her and then berate her for confiding in family and friends about the episode — was triggered by the then few other stories that had come out about him.\\n\\n“Very, and it’s been months of me trying to process through it all,” Paltrow, who worked with Weinstein several times after the incident, said. “It only happened one time and I confronted him and he never tried anything like that again, but he was [always] a bully about work things, he was shaming, he was really hard on me and then was incredibly generous and would send me a private plane somewhere. It was a kind of typical abusive relationship and I hadn’t processed it, because so much of my acting career and so many of the incredible highs and lows, as well, were associated with him and Miramax.”\\n\\nPaltrow added that the experience of going public has “brought up a lot of stuff lately” including abuse from her childhood, a topic that Winfrey spoke of her own experiences with during the podcast, and said she’s recently begun to question whether her decision to mostly leave acting when she had her first child was actually related to her experiences with Weinstein.\\n\\n“I always told myself the story that I’d lost the passion for it and then I had my daughter and I wanted to be home and now I’m starting to put the pieces together and thinking did this predominate relationship in my professional life lead me to not want to do it anymore?”\\n\\nWinfrey said that so many negative experiences with Weinstein “certainly had an influence” but also admitted that her hope for the #MeToo movement goes beyond women’s rights, and that it continues to facilitate what she and Paltrow agreed has become “a culture of enough.”\\n\\n“I’m hoping that it leads to a better way of all human beings treating each other and that this moment in the movement is leading to us toward saying, ‘Not only am I not going to take your sexual harassment, I’m not going to take any of your bulls–t.’ Period. I think we’re on our way but we’re still figuring it out.”</td>\n",

Read at your own risk.\\n\\nRaúl Esparza has officially exited Law & Order: SVU after six seasons. The actor joined the show in season 14 as Assistant District Attorney Rafael Barba in a recurring capacity before being promoted to series regular in season 15.\\n\\nIn a recent episode, Barba made the difficult decision to pull the plug on a brain-dead child, leading to his departure from the District Attorney's office. Although Esparza has left the series as a regular, there is a possibility for him to return in the future. Chicago Justice character Peter Stone, played by Philip Winchester, has now taken over as the new ADA and is expected to continue with the show if it gets renewed for another season.\\n\\nSVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin expressed his admiration for Esparza's performance, saying, \"The power, sensitivity, and morality he brought to the character of Rafael Barba never failed to elevate our scripts. Raúl is family, and we look forward to seeing his talent shine in new projects. As for Barba, SVU fans may see him again soon.\"\\n\\nWhile SVU has been on the air for 19 seasons, the show has not experienced much turnover in recent years. Esparza's exit marks a significant departure from the series, following the departures of other original cast members like Christopher Meloni, Richard Belzer, Dann Florek, and Danny Pino.\\n\\nFollowing his departure from SVU, Esparza will temporarily return to his Broadway roots for a Chess revival at the Kennedy Center. It remains unclear what projects he will take on after that.\\n\\nIn an interview, Esparza revealed that leaving SVU was his decision after six seasons. He explained, \"I had explored a lot of what I thought Barba was about, and I just felt it was time to move on. I was also feeling like the role has changed over the years in a way that has been an interesting experience for me.\"\\n\\nEsparza also expressed his fondness for his co-star Mariska Hargitay and his desire to work with her again, saying, \"Any opportunity to get back into a room with her is valuable to me.\"\\n\\nAlthough there were hints of a potential romance between Barba and Hargitay's character, Benson, Esparza believed that exploring their private lives would remove the excitement and allure of their relationship.\\n\\nEsparza shared that he felt satisfied with the development of his character, Barba, during his time on the show.

The medical examiner ruled his death as accidental.\\n\\nAccording to TMZ, a mixture of other drugs was also found in Lil Peep's system. His blood tested positive for marijuana, cocaine, and the painkiller Tramadol, while his urine tested positive for those drugs as well as opiates like hydrocodone, generic Dilauded, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. However, no traces of alcohol were detected.\\n\\nLil Peep, born Gustav Åhr, passed away last month at the age of 21 in Tucson, Arizona, where he was scheduled to perform a concert in support of his debut album, \"Come Over When You’re Sober (Part One)\". Although local authorities initially considered his death to be \"suspicious,\" the Tucson police department had previously speculated that it resulted from a combination of Xanax and other drugs.\\n\\nAuthorities are currently investigating text messages sent by a woman who had visited Lil Peep's tour bus before his demise. Allegedly, one of the messages read, \"GBC [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol,\" while another supposedly stated, \"He passed the fuck out my brother called, and I tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up.\"\\n\\nRecently, a memorial was held in Long Beach, New York, to honor the rapper, known for his unique blend of hip-hop and guitar-driven emo. The memorial featured speakers and a public gathering.\\n\\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, Lil Peep had previously shared that he never took prescriptions for depression but enjoyed indulging in drugs. He stated, \"I just like smoking weed and whatever other drug comes my way. I don't like to pay for [drugs]. I just like to get them for free.\"   \n",
       "4  Goop is kicking off its weekly podcast in a big way. Oprah Winfrey is Goop’s inaugural guest on its podcast, hosted by founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and the hour-plus conversation touches on everything Oprah, from her decades as an inimitable television host to her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her ultimate hope for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations, or lack thereof.\\n\\nWinfrey said she was friendly with Weinstein in a professional capacity from the days of her eponymous talk show, but addressed accusations that she must have known of his allegedly long history of sexually predatory behavior toward female actors and other women, saying she simply had no idea and wasn’t really in that world of entertainment. But she did know that everyone dreaded getting a call from him.\\n\\n“I was in Chicago, in my own little world, but what I knew about Harvey was that Harvey was a bully and that if Harvey’s on the phone, you didn’t want to take the call because you’re going to get bullied in some way,” Winfrey said.\\n\\nWhile for her a call from Weinstein generally meant being pressured, in a way left undefined, to have certain people on her show, now Winfrey is left wondering why she even let herself be bullied at all.\\n\\n“What I do question for myself is why I was willing to put up with a bullying thing?” Winfrey said. “I was willing to put up with, ‘OK I’ll take the call,’ ‘OK I’ll do that’…why am I willing to put up with an a–hole? Why we won’t tolerate other things, but you can throw phones and call people jerks or whatever and do all this nasty stuff.”\\n\\nAs for why Weinstein’s alleged behavior was a watershed for the long-normalized harassment and sexual abuse of women, despite many previous public allegations against not only Weinstein but other high-profile men, Winfrey thinks it’s something akin to critical mass.\\n\\n“It had been coming, it had been coming,” Winfrey said. “It had been coming with [Bill] Cosby and nothing happened, it had been coming with Bill O’Reilly, even with the President of the United States, where people can hear the Access Hollywood tape and yet, nothing happens. It had been coming and [Weinstein] was the moment was where it all crystallized.…In order for a phenomenon to be a phenomenon everything has to line up. It means the culture, the zeitgeist, for a particular moment in time to be ready, available and open to hear that message.”\\n\\nThe idea that these issues and women’s experiences with abuse and harassment have been building up in the culture for so long, with most women throughout history being unable to speak up because it would likely have meant further harm to them and their families, was what Winfrey was trying to get across in her acceptance speech at this year’s Golden Globes — not a political platform.\\n\\n“I wasn’t trying to run for any office,” Winfrey said of the speech. “I wanted to be able to say to the #MeToo movement, I’m proud of where we are and what we’re doing, but you need to know you didn’t get here alone. There are those who endured, suffered and didn’t speak because they couldn’t speak.”\\n\\nWinfrey slipped back into her role of interviewer and asked Paltrow if her decision to go public last fall with her own Weinstein story — wherein the producer got her as a relatively unestablished young actor to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and proceeded to unabashedly proposition her and then berate her for confiding in family and friends about the episode — was triggered by the then few other stories that had come out about him.\\n\\n“Very, and it’s been months of me trying to process through it all,” Paltrow, who worked with Weinstein several times after the incident, said. “It only happened one time and I confronted him and he never tried anything like that again, but he was [always] a bully about work things, he was shaming, he was really hard on me and then was incredibly generous and would send me a private plane somewhere. It was a kind of typical abusive relationship and I hadn’t processed it, because so much of my acting career and so many of the incredible highs and lows, as well, were associated with him and Miramax.”\\n\\nPaltrow added that the experience of going public has “brought up a lot of stuff lately” including abuse from her childhood, a topic that Winfrey spoke of her own experiences with during the podcast, and said she’s recently begun to question whether her decision to mostly leave acting when she had her first child was actually related to her experiences with Weinstein.\\n\\n“I always told myself the story that I’d lost the passion for it and then I had my daughter and I wanted to be home and now I’m starting to put the pieces together and thinking did this predominate relationship in my professional life lead me to not want to do it anymore?”\\n\\nWinfrey said that so many negative experiences with Weinstein “certainly had an influence” but also admitted that her hope for the #MeToo movement goes beyond women’s rights, and that it continues to facilitate what she and Paltrow agreed has become “a culture of enough.”\\n\\n“I’m hoping that it leads to a better way of all human beings treating each other and that this moment in the movement is leading to us toward saying, ‘Not only am I not going to take your sexual harassment, I’m not going to take any of your bulls–t.’ Period. I think we’re on our way but we’re still figuring it out.”   \n",

The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester currently reside in the 21-bedroom home, which is located right next door to Prince William and Kate, who live in Apartment 1A.

Princess Michael previously hinted that the apartment will be free for new residents some day, telling Tatler back in 2014 that Prince William and Kate have a \"lovely big apartment, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave their enormous apartment because their children have gone.\"\\n\\nGALLERY: Best photos from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's awards evening with the Queen\\n\\nAdding to speculations that this will be their future home, is the fact that Meghan and Harry have admitted they hope to one day have children.

Speaking about getting to know one another, Harry said: \"We had to sort of reverse the whole process and cosy nights in, in front of the television, cooking dinner with just the two of us by ourselves in our little cottage rather going out for dinner and being seen in public... And has made us a hell of a lot closer in a short space of time.\" The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex also have to option of moving into apartments eight and nine, which were also Harry's childhood home.\\n\\nVIDEO: Prince Harry to the rescue!

          Prince Harry and Meghan currently live at Kensington Palace's Nottingham Cottage, but should the couple look for a larger residence in the future, one of the likely options – Apartment 1 at the Palace - received a huge £1.4million investment to replace the roof. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester currently reside in the 21-bedroom home, which is located right next door to Prince William and Kate, who live in Apartment 1A. According to the annual Sovereign Grant report: \"The existing roof required complete renewal after years of patch repairs, evidence of batten decay and structural defects in some chimneys.\"\\n\\nThe couple are rumoured to move into a new apartment at Kensington Palace\\n\\nIt has been reported that upon announcing their engagement in 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester offered to give up their home and will be moving to the Queen's former secretary's former home, although they remained in the apartment for the 11 months the renovations were taking place and a palace spokesperson confirmed that the pair \"still live in Apartment 1 and that is continuing to be the case\". Princess Michael previously hinted that the apartment will be free for new residents some day, telling Tatler back in 2014 that Prince William and Kate have a \"lovely big apartment, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave their enormous apartment because their children have gone.\"\\n\\nGALLERY: Best photos from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's awards evening with the Queen\\n\\nAdding to speculations that this will be their future home, is the fact that Meghan and Harry have admitted they hope to one day have children. And in that case, they'll need to expand out of the cottage they described as \"little\" in their first televised interview as an engaged couple back in 2017. Speaking about getting to know one another, Harry said: \"We had to sort of reverse the whole process and cosy nights in, in front of the television, cooking dinner with just the two of us by ourselves in our little cottage rather going out for dinner and being seen in public... And has made us a hell of a lot closer in a short space of time.\" The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex also have to option of moving into apartments eight and nine, which were also Harry's childhood home.\\n\\nVIDEO: Prince Harry to the rescue!

She has many reasons,” a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.\\n\\nGarner, 46, and Affleck, 45, who called it quits in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.\\n\\nThough the Batman star officially got together with Shookus, 38, after Garner and Affleck’s filing, a confidant previously confirmed to Us that their relationship started as early as 2014. As a result, the source notes that one of reasons the Love, Simon actress does not want the Saturday Night Live producer around her kids is “the fact that Ben had an affair with her.”\\n\\nHowever, the exes are keeping the peace. According to the insider, “Ben understands and has honored her request.”\\n\\nIn order to view the video, please allow Manage Cookies\\n\\n“They’re good friends,” the source adds. “She wants him to be honest and he usually is. She tends to find out about things, and Ben is very open with her. They both want what’s best for the kids and have made a commitment to see that through.”\\n\\nWhile the estranged couple filed for divorce in 2017, the paperwork has yet to be finalized, partially due to Affleck’s past struggles with alcohol abuse.\\n\\n“The one thing she’s not flexible on is sobriety,” the source tells Us. “Jen is hesitant to sign off until she’s certain that the kids will be in the best hands at all time. Finalizing the divorce has been a long process because of it.”\\n\\nFor more on Garner and Affleck’s post-divorce relationship, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!   \n",

       "      <td>Warning: This story contains major spoilers from a recent episode of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit. Read at your own risk.\\n\\nThe actor joined SVU as Assistant District Attorney Rafael Barba in season 14 in a recurring capacity, before being upped to series regular in season 15.\\n\\nDuring Wednesday's episode, Barba ultimately left the District Attorney's office after pulling the plug on a brain-dead child. Esparza has effectively exited as a series regular, but the door is open for him to return. In his stead, Chicago Justice character Peter Stone (Philip Winchester) has become the new ADA, with Winchester being added to the show as a regular who will likely continue with the show next season should it be renewed.\\n\\n\"It has truly been an honor writing for Raúl,\" SVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin says. \"The power, sensitivity, and morality he brought to the character of Rafael Barba never failed to elevate our scripts. Raúl is family and we look forward to seeing his talent shine in new projects. As for Barba, SVU fans may see him again soon.\"\\n\\nThough SVU has been on for 19 seasons, the show hasn't seen too much turnover in recent years. After Christopher Meloni exited in season 12, fellow originals Richard Belzer and Dann Florek both left in season 15. Danny Pino, who joined the show in season 13, was the show's last big exit back in season 16.\\n\\nFollowing his departure, Esparza is temporarily returning to his Broadway roots for a Chess revival at the Kennedy Center. What's next for him after that? And why did he decide to leave SVU now? Read our full interview to get the scoop:\\n\\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Was it your decision to leave the series?\\n\\nRAUL ESPARZA: Yes.\\n\\nWhy did you decide to leave now?\\n\\nI've done six seasons, I felt like it was time to go. I had explored a lot of what I thought Barba was about. I just felt it was time to move on. I was also feeling like the role has changed over the years in a way that has been an interesting experience for me. Again, I'm a theater guy, so it's like having a script in front of you that keeps changing every time you go to do it. The learning process of how roles grow over a period of time with a series has been kind of fascinating, and I just felt I had reached the end of what I wanted to explore where they were writing.\\n\\nYou were also close with former SVU showrunner Warren Leight, who exited a few seasons back. Was that a factor in your decision to leave?\\n\\nYeah, I think that's pretty much understood. [Laughs]\\n\\nWere you surprised by the way in which Barba exited the series?\\n\\nYeah, it wasn't really a way that I figured that he would go out. But I do have to say that when we worked on the script, it was pretty extraordinary. I don't watch myself, so I haven't seen the episode, but putting it together was a really great experience. It's one of those things that you just learn as you go, what a script really is, and it was a surprising one. I think that [current showrunner] Michael Chernuchin has done some really beautiful writing for Barba this season, in a way that's like a really beautiful gift that got handed to me. Because I had decided to leave at the beginning of the season before he came in, and then they hand me this beautiful gift with some really gorgeous writing from a new showrunner, who has really taken care of me this year. And this particular script was something very dear to him. As we began to do it I started to find that it was challenging, and emotional, and surprising, and not at all what I expected from having just read it on the page.\\n\\nWere there alternate ways in which Barba could leave, like him dying?\\n\\nI'll say that the one thing we talked about is he absolutely doesn't need to die because it's not like I'm leaving on bad terms. I think that Barba's become a part of the SVU family, and I think there's a life for him—I don't know necessarily, but it's possible that there's a life for him as the series goes on. I'm glad they left that door open.\\n\\nWould you be interested in returning to SVU in the future?\\n\\nAbsolutely, because I'm really rooting for the opportunity to make television history with the series. I'd be lying if I didn't say that's part of what we all hope for, that NBC manages in the end to get a record-breaking series on its hands with potential 21 years. Also, this doesn't always happen when you work with people, but I became friends with Mariska [Hargitay] and she's part of my life now. I don't just miss the role, I miss her, so any opportunity to get back into a room with her is valuable to me. Part of the reason I became Barba, and that it turned into the show that it did for me, was the way I hit it off with her and that was surprising. What was supposed to be a guest-starring spot that Warren had written for me morphed into something very rich and surprising, and I really am not blowing smoke when I say it's entirely because of the space that was created between me and Mariska. It's chemistry—it happens or doesn't, and it happened.\\n\\nIt almost seemed like there was a potential for romance between Barba and Benson. Did you ever think the show would go that route?\\n\\nNo, I didn't, honestly, because they are both workaholics. I was never really interested in exploring his private life as much in terms of feeling like he's a man who has given up on relationships in order to succeed. His ambition has driven him. Maybe that's making an excuse for what they do or don't write on shows like Law &amp; Order, but Benson's life is a much more complicated situation. I always thought it would remove a layer of excitement and friction and sexiness between us if we ever went in that direction. I really thought that would just state the obvious instead of letting it just simmer, which one of the rules of good television is keep them wanting—never have successful relationships and keep them wanting the one that you really wish would happen.\\n\\nIs there anything you wish you got to do with Barba that you didn't get a chance to?\\n\\nHonestly, no. If the show had been a different kind of show, it'd be fun to spin into the political world of what the DAs office is all about, but that's not really what Law &amp; Order: SVU is about. When they do the Barba spin-off, maybe we can go in that direction, right? [Laughs] I think New York politics in the mayor's office and with the district attorney's office is fascinating, but that would be a different world. That's the only thing we glanced at, but never really got into it. Other than that, I feel like Barba turned out to be both a showman and someone who slowly reined in his ambition to become a truly top-notch prosecutor. His intelligence was ferocious, his turn-of-phrase and the ways that Benson changed him were apparent to me season by season, and the ways that he changed her were also really alive for me. So that's pretty rich stuff to get to play with.\\n\\nLaw &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - Season 19 Credit: Michael Parmelee/NBC\\n\\nWhat was it like having Sam Waterston and Philip Winchester come in for your final episode?\\n\\nIt was ridiculous. First of all, Philip is one of the coolest, nicest guys I've gotten the opportunity to work with and welcoming him to SVU-land was pretty wonderful. For years, long before I had anything to do with Law &amp; Order, Sam Waterston's performance as Jack McCoy is one of the great TV performances. I feel like it was a benchmark for me of excellence in what you could do in a procedural with material that didn't reveal a great deal about a character except for what they did, and he revealed an entire life and an entire person for so many years. I think Sam's a truly great actor, so he paid me an enormous compliment by coming in to see Barba off. It was a little bit of a passing of a baton, but also an opportunity for me to have what felt like a total career highlight. And I'm not making that up, it was thrilling that time I got to spend with him—for the admiration, for the role, and for him in it and just to have his presence there. Even though we are on the series, you still get a little bit starstruck when some of the main people from the first show, show up. You just do. It's a little like, \"Oh yeah, wow, because I've been watching you since I was whatever age.\"\\n\\nAs you're in the middle of rehearsals for Chess right now, was getting back into the world of Broadway a priority for you?\\n\\nI mean, I miss it. There's this amazing concert, we're doing the musical Chess, which has not had a Broadway revival in 30 years, and so we're looking at it and have been working on it. It's just really a ferociously cool cast and we started reading it last summer, and we are going to do it at the Kennedy Center concert next week. So that's what I'm doing and beyond that, I have no sense of what the Broadway world holds. It's part of my career and of course, I miss it because I miss the relationship to the audience. I love being on stage, but I would be lying if I didn't say that doing SVU and then doing Hannibal at the same time, and doing the kind of work that I've been doing for the last few years, hasn't been a total amazing head rush. There is something to be missed of a live performance, but this is a whole new world that I am really thrilled to be a part of, and I don't plan on leaving it. This season, I'm playing a professor on The Path for Hulu, and that was a fantastic arc to be part of and work with Michelle Monaghan, Aaron [Paul], and Hugh [Dancy], who I worked with on Hannibal. To go back and forth between that and SVU this year was thrilling, and also seeing the ways that television is being made, the differences between the ways that shows are made, and learning in every cast that I'm part of how the whole experience comes together. I still feel like a newbie at this.\\n\\nI look back at some of my episodes when I first started: I'm not bad, I'm good, that's great. But then I see stuff now and I'm like, holy sh--, I've learned so much about how to do this thing. The relationship with the camera, the camera can read your mind. There's no audience in any theater that can do what a camera can do. Let's not kid ourselves, on Broadway—well, maybe not right now, I mean with the way that social media has changed some of the things that happen on stage—but for the most part, you're famous in a 10-block radius. What a television series does is put you in people's homes all over the world. It just completely transforms how far your acting can go and who it reaches. I am most grateful for the opportunity of rounding out my career. It was a big theater career, and now I've been able to do these other projects. I mean, just last season—I was thinking about it before we started this interview—Bojack Horseman, Ferdinand, which I can't believe they got nominated for an Oscar for that, and then the work on The Path and the work on SVU, and now working on a Broadway musical, it's pretty thrilling.\\n\\nAny dream shows you would want to appear on?\\n\\nRight now, I'm kind of obsessing over The Crown. And who doesn't want to be on Game of Thrones, honestly? But for years, my go-to was, \"I just want to be a zombie on The Walking Dead.\" [Laughs] Oh yeah, especially as soon as Danai [Gurira] joined, because Danai and I were in a film for Wes Craven many years ago, and as soon as she was on it, I was like, \"Oh come on, I just wanna be there, just be like King Zombie, just one episode.\" It's hard to watch television when you're making television. I've been catching up on some shows, and right now I'm currently obsessing about The Crown. I think it's some of the best acting I've seen on TV. I'm like, \"Huh, I wonder if there's a role I can play there?\"\\n\\nLaw &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Lil Peep died of an overdose of fentanyl and generic Xanax, according to the Pima Country Office of the Medical Examiner. The rapper’s death was ruled as accidental by the medical examiner.\\n\\nTMZ reports that a cocktail of other drugs were also found in his system. His blood tested positive for marijuana, cocaine and the painkiller Tramadol, and his urine tested positive for those drugs, as well as opiates such as hydrocodone, generic Dilauded, oxycodone and oxymorphone. The medical examiner did not find alcohol in his system.\\n\\nPeep, whose real name was Gustav Åhr, died last month in Tucson, Arizona, where he was supposed to hold a concert in support of his debut album, Come Over When You’re Sober (Part One). He was 21. Local authorities speculated that the circumstances around the rapper’s death were “suspicious,” though at the time the Tucson police department was under the assumption his death was caused by a combination of Xanax and other drugs.\\n\\nThe authorities said they were investigating text messages sent by a woman who’d visited Peep’s tour bus before his death. “GBC [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol,” read one allegedly. Another supposedly read, “He passed the fuck out my brother called and I tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up.”\\n\\nA memorial for the rapper, who blended hip-hop with guitar-driven emo, was recently held in Long Beach, New York, featuring speakers and a public gathering.\\n\\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, the rapper said he never took prescriptions for depression but enjoyed taking drugs. “I just like smoking weed and whatever other drug comes my way,” He said. “I don’t like to pay for [drugs].

       "      <td>Goop is kicking off its weekly podcast in a big way. Oprah big. Oprah Winfrey is Goop’s inaugural guest on its podcast, hosted by founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and the hour-plus conversation touches on everything Oprah, from her decades as an inimitable television host to her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her ultimate hope for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations, or lack thereof.\\n\\nWinfrey said she was friendly with Weinstein in a professional capacity from the days of her eponymous talk show, but addressed accusations that she must have known of his allegedly long history of sexually predatory behavior toward female actors and other women, saying she simply had no idea and wasn’t really in that world of entertainment. But she did know that everyone dreaded getting a call from him.\\n\\n“I was in Chicago, in my own little world, but what I knew about Harvey was that Harvey was a bully and that if Harvey’s on the phone, you didn’t want to take the call because you’re going to get bullied in some way,” Winfrey said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile for her a call from Weinstein generally meant being pressured, in a way left undefined, to have certain people on her show, now Winfrey is left wondering why she even let herself be bullied at all.\\n\\n“What I do question for myself is why I was willing to put up with a bullying thing?” Winfrey said. “I was willing to put up with, ‘OK I’ll take the call,’ ‘OK I’ll do that’…why am I willing to put up with an a–hole? Why we won’t tolerate other things, but you can throw phones and call people jerks or whatever and do all this nasty stuff.”\\n\\nAs for why Weinstein’s alleged behavior was a watershed for the long-normalized harassment and sexual abuse of women, despite many previous public allegations against not only Weinstein but other high-profile men, Winfrey thinks it’s something akin to critical mass.\\n\\n“It had been coming, it had been coming,” Winfrey said. “It had been coming with [Bill] Cosby and nothing happened, it had been coming with Bill O’Reilly, even with the President of the United States, where people can hear the Access Hollywood tape and yet, nothing happens. It had been coming and [Weinstein] was the moment was where it all crystallized.…In order for a phenomenon to be a phenomenon everything has to line up. It means the culture, the zeitgeist, for a particular moment in time to be ready, available and open to hear that message.”\\n\\nThe idea that these issues and women’s experiences with abuse and harassment have been building up in the culture for so long, with most women throughout history being unable to speak up because it would likely have meant further harm to them and their families, was what Winfrey was trying to get across in her acceptance speech at this year’s Golden Globes — not a political platform.\\n\\n“I wasn’t trying to run for any office,” Winfrey said of the speech. “I wanted to be able to say to the #MeToo movement, I’m proud of where we are and what we’re doing, but you need to know you didn’t get here alone. There are those who endured, suffered and didn’t speak because they couldn’t speak.”\\n\\nWinfrey slipped back into her role of interviewer and asked Paltrow if her decision to go public last fall with her own Weinstein story — wherein the producer got her as a relatively unestablished young actor to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and proceeded to unabashedly proposition her and then berate her for confiding in family and friends about the episode — was triggered by the then few other stories that had come out about him.\\n\\n“Very, and it’s been months of me trying to process through it all,” Paltrow, who worked with Weinstein several times after the incident, said. “It only happened one time and I confronted him and he never tried anything like that again, but he was [always] a bully about work things, he was shaming, he was really hard on me and then was incredibly generous and would send me a private plane somewhere. It was a kind of typical abusive relationship and I hadn’t processed it, because so much of my acting career and so many of the incredible highs and lows, as well, were associated with him and Miramax.”\\n\\nPaltrow added that the experience of going public has “brought up a lot of stuff lately” including abuse from her childhood, a topic that Winfrey spoke of her own experiences with during the podcast, and said she’s recently begun to question whether her decision to mostly leave acting when she had her first child was actually related to her experiences with Weinstein.\\n\\n“I always told myself the story that I’d lost the passion for it and then I had my daughter and I wanted to be home and now I’m starting to put the pieces together and thinking did this predominate relationship in my professional life lead me to not want to do it anymore?”\\n\\nWinfrey said that so many negative experiences with Weinstein “certainly had an influence” but also admitted that her hope for the #MeToo movement goes beyond women’s rights, and that it continues to facilitate what she and Paltrow agreed has become “a culture of enough.”\\n\\n“I’m hoping that it leads to a better way of all human beings treating each other and that this moment in the movement is leading to us toward saying, ‘Not only am I not going to take your sexual harassment, I’m not going to take any of your bulls–t.’ Period. I think we’re on our way but we’re still figuring it out.”</td>\n",

       "2  Warning: This story contains major spoilers from a recent episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Read at your own risk.\\n\\nThe actor joined SVU as Assistant District Attorney Rafael Barba in season 14 in a recurring capacity, before being upped to series regular in season 15.\\n\\nDuring Wednesday's episode, Barba ultimately left the District Attorney's office after pulling the plug on a brain-dead child. Esparza has effectively exited as a series regular, but the door is open for him to return. In his stead, Chicago Justice character Peter Stone (Philip Winchester) has become the new ADA, with Winchester being added to the show as a regular who will likely continue with the show next season should it be renewed.\\n\\n\"It has truly been an honor writing for Raúl,\" SVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin says. \"The power, sensitivity, and morality he brought to the character of Rafael Barba never failed to elevate our scripts. Raúl is family and we look forward to seeing his talent shine in new projects. As for Barba, SVU fans may see him again soon.\"\\n\\nThough SVU has been on for 19 seasons, the show hasn't seen too much turnover in recent years. After Christopher Meloni exited in season 12, fellow originals Richard Belzer and Dann Florek both left in season 15. Danny Pino, who joined the show in season 13, was the show's last big exit back in season 16.\\n\\nFollowing his departure, Esparza is temporarily returning to his Broadway roots for a Chess revival at the Kennedy Center. What's next for him after that? And why did he decide to leave SVU now? Read our full interview to get the scoop:\\n\\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Was it your decision to leave the series?\\n\\nRAUL ESPARZA: Yes.\\n\\nWhy did you decide to leave now?\\n\\nI've done six seasons, I felt like it was time to go. I had explored a lot of what I thought Barba was about. I just felt it was time to move on. I was also feeling like the role has changed over the years in a way that has been an interesting experience for me. Again, I'm a theater guy, so it's like having a script in front of you that keeps changing every time you go to do it. The learning process of how roles grow over a period of time with a series has been kind of fascinating, and I just felt I had reached the end of what I wanted to explore where they were writing.\\n\\nYou were also close with former SVU showrunner Warren Leight, who exited a few seasons back. Was that a factor in your decision to leave?\\n\\nYeah, I think that's pretty much understood. [Laughs]\\n\\nWere you surprised by the way in which Barba exited the series?\\n\\nYeah, it wasn't really a way that I figured that he would go out. But I do have to say that when we worked on the script, it was pretty extraordinary. I don't watch myself, so I haven't seen the episode, but putting it together was a really great experience. It's one of those things that you just learn as you go, what a script really is, and it was a surprising one. I think that [current showrunner] Michael Chernuchin has done some really beautiful writing for Barba this season, in a way that's like a really beautiful gift that got handed to me. Because I had decided to leave at the beginning of the season before he came in, and then they hand me this beautiful gift with some really gorgeous writing from a new showrunner, who has really taken care of me this year. And this particular script was something very dear to him. As we began to do it I started to find that it was challenging, and emotional, and surprising, and not at all what I expected from having just read it on the page.\\n\\nWere there alternate ways in which Barba could leave, like him dying?\\n\\nI'll say that the one thing we talked about is he absolutely doesn't need to die because it's not like I'm leaving on bad terms. I think that Barba's become a part of the SVU family, and I think there's a life for him—I don't know necessarily, but it's possible that there's a life for him as the series goes on. I'm glad they left that door open.\\n\\nWould you be interested in returning to SVU in the future?\\n\\nAbsolutely, because I'm really rooting for the opportunity to make television history with the series. I'd be lying if I didn't say that's part of what we all hope for, that NBC manages in the end to get a record-breaking series on its hands with potential 21 years. Also, this doesn't always happen when you work with people, but I became friends with Mariska [Hargitay] and she's part of my life now. I don't just miss the role, I miss her, so any opportunity to get back into a room with her is valuable to me. Part of the reason I became Barba, and that it turned into the show that it did for me, was the way I hit it off with her and that was surprising. What was supposed to be a guest-starring spot that Warren had written for me morphed into something very rich and surprising, and I really am not blowing smoke when I say it's entirely because of the space that was created between me and Mariska. It's chemistry—it happens or doesn't, and it happened.\\n\\nIt almost seemed like there was a potential for romance between Barba and Benson. Did you ever think the show would go that route?\\n\\nNo, I didn't, honestly, because they are both workaholics. I was never really interested in exploring his private life as much in terms of feeling like he's a man who has given up on relationships in order to succeed. His ambition has driven him. Maybe that's making an excuse for what they do or don't write on shows like Law & Order, but Benson's life is a much more complicated situation. I always thought it would remove a layer of excitement and friction and sexiness between us if we ever went in that direction. I really thought that would just state the obvious instead of letting it just simmer, which one of the rules of good television is keep them wanting—never have successful relationships and keep them wanting the one that you really wish would happen.\\n\\nIs there anything you wish you got to do with Barba that you didn't get a chance to?\\n\\nHonestly, no. If the show had been a different kind of show, it'd be fun to spin into the political world of what the DAs office is all about, but that's not really what Law & Order: SVU is about. When they do the Barba spin-off, maybe we can go in that direction, right? [Laughs] I think New York politics in the mayor's office and with the district attorney's office is fascinating, but that would be a different world. That's the only thing we glanced at, but never really got into it. Other than that, I feel like Barba turned out to be both a showman and someone who slowly reined in his ambition to become a truly top-notch prosecutor. His intelligence was ferocious, his turn-of-phrase and the ways that Benson changed him were apparent to me season by season, and the ways that he changed her were also really alive for me. So that's pretty rich stuff to get to play with.\\n\\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit - Season 19 Credit: Michael Parmelee/NBC\\n\\nWhat was it like having Sam Waterston and Philip Winchester come in for your final episode?\\n\\nIt was ridiculous. First of all, Philip is one of the coolest, nicest guys I've gotten the opportunity to work with and welcoming him to SVU-land was pretty wonderful. For years, long before I had anything to do with Law & Order, Sam Waterston's performance as Jack McCoy is one of the great TV performances. I feel like it was a benchmark for me of excellence in what you could do in a procedural with material that didn't reveal a great deal about a character except for what they did, and he revealed an entire life and an entire person for so many years. I think Sam's a truly great actor, so he paid me an enormous compliment by coming in to see Barba off. It was a little bit of a passing of a baton, but also an opportunity for me to have what felt like a total career highlight. And I'm not making that up, it was thrilling that time I got to spend with him—for the admiration, for the role, and for him in it and just to have his presence there. Even though we are on the series, you still get a little bit starstruck when some of the main people from the first show, show up. You just do. It's a little like, \"Oh yeah, wow, because I've been watching you since I was whatever age.\"\\n\\nAs you're in the middle of rehearsals for Chess right now, was getting back into the world of Broadway a priority for you?\\n\\nI mean, I miss it. There's this amazing concert, we're doing the musical Chess, which has not had a Broadway revival in 30 years, and so we're looking at it and have been working on it. It's just really a ferociously cool cast and we started reading it last summer, and we are going to do it at the Kennedy Center concert next week. So that's what I'm doing and beyond that, I have no sense of what the Broadway world holds. It's part of my career and of course, I miss it because I miss the relationship to the audience. I love being on stage, but I would be lying if I didn't say that doing SVU and then doing Hannibal at the same time, and doing the kind of work that I've been doing for the last few years, hasn't been a total amazing head rush. There is something to be missed of a live performance, but this is a whole new world that I am really thrilled to be a part of, and I don't plan on leaving it. This season, I'm playing a professor on The Path for Hulu, and that was a fantastic arc to be part of and work with Michelle Monaghan, Aaron [Paul], and Hugh [Dancy], who I worked with on Hannibal. To go back and forth between that and SVU this year was thrilling, and also seeing the ways that television is being made, the differences between the ways that shows are made, and learning in every cast that I'm part of how the whole experience comes together. I still feel like a newbie at this.\\n\\nI look back at some of my episodes when I first started: I'm not bad, I'm good, that's great. But then I see stuff now and I'm like, holy sh--, I've learned so much about how to do this thing. The relationship with the camera, the camera can read your mind. There's no audience in any theater that can do what a camera can do. Let's not kid ourselves, on Broadway—well, maybe not right now, I mean with the way that social media has changed some of the things that happen on stage—but for the most part, you're famous in a 10-block radius. What a television series does is put you in people's homes all over the world. It just completely transforms how far your acting can go and who it reaches. I am most grateful for the opportunity of rounding out my career. It was a big theater career, and now I've been able to do these other projects. I mean, just last season—I was thinking about it before we started this interview—Bojack Horseman, Ferdinand, which I can't believe they got nominated for an Oscar for that, and then the work on The Path and the work on SVU, and now working on a Broadway musical, it's pretty thrilling.\\n\\nAny dream shows you would want to appear on?\\n\\nRight now, I'm kind of obsessing over The Crown. And who doesn't want to be on Game of Thrones, honestly? But for years, my go-to was, \"I just want to be a zombie on The Walking Dead.\" [Laughs] Oh yeah, especially as soon as Danai [Gurira] joined, because Danai and I were in a film for Wes Craven many years ago, and as soon as she was on it, I was like, \"Oh come on, I just wanna be there, just be like King Zombie, just one episode.\" It's hard to watch television when you're making television. I've been catching up on some shows, and right now I'm currently obsessing about The Crown. I think it's some of the best acting I've seen on TV. I'm like, \"Huh, I wonder if there's a role I can play there?\"\\n\\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.   \n",

         Lil Peep died of an overdose of fentanyl and generic Xanax, according to the Pima Country Office of the Medical Examiner. The rapper’s death was ruled as accidental by the medical examiner.\\n\\nTMZ reports that a cocktail of other drugs were also found in his system. His blood tested positive for marijuana, cocaine and the painkiller Tramadol, and his urine tested positive for those drugs, as well as opiates such as hydrocodone, generic Dilauded, oxycodone and oxymorphone. The medical examiner did not find alcohol in his system.\\n\\nPeep, whose real name was Gustav Åhr, died last month in Tucson, Arizona, where he was supposed to hold a concert in support of his debut album, Come Over When You’re Sober (Part One). He was 21. Local authorities speculated that the circumstances around the rapper’s death were “suspicious,” though at the time the Tucson police department was under the assumption his death was caused by a combination of Xanax and other drugs.\\n\\nThe authorities said they were investigating text messages sent by a woman who’d visited Peep’s tour bus before his death. “GBC [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol,” read one allegedly. Another supposedly read, “He passed the fuck out my brother called and I tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up.”\\n\\nA memorial for the rapper, who blended hip-hop with guitar-driven emo, was recently held in Long Beach, New York, featuring speakers and a public gathering.\\n\\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, the rapper said he never took prescriptions for depression but enjoyed taking drugs. “I just like smoking weed and whatever other drug comes my way,” He said. “I don’t like to pay for [drugs]. I just like to get them for free.”   \n",

Oprah big. Oprah Winfrey is Goop’s inaugural guest on its podcast, hosted by founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and the hour-plus conversation touches on everything Oprah, from her decades as an inimitable television host to her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her ultimate hope for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations, or lack thereof.\\n\\nWinfrey said she was friendly with Weinstein in a professional capacity from the days of her eponymous talk show, but addressed accusations that she must have known of his allegedly long history of sexually predatory behavior toward female actors and other women, saying she simply had no idea and wasn’t really in that world of entertainment. But she did know that everyone dreaded getting a call from him.\\n\\n“I was in Chicago, in my own little world, but what I knew about Harvey was that Harvey was a bully and that if Harvey’s on the phone, you didn’t want to take the call because you’re going to get bullied in some way,” Winfrey said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhile for her a call from Weinstein generally meant being pressured, in a way left undefined, to have certain people on her show, now Winfrey is left wondering why she even let herself be bullied at all.\\n\\n“What I do question for myself is why I was willing to put up with a bullying thing?” Winfrey said. “I was willing to put up with, ‘OK I’ll take the call,’ ‘OK I’ll do that’…why am I willing to put up with an a–hole? Why we won’t tolerate other things, but you can throw phones and call people jerks or whatever and do all this nasty stuff.”\\n\\nAs for why Weinstein’s alleged behavior was a watershed for the long-normalized harassment and sexual abuse of women, despite many previous public allegations against not only Weinstein but other high-profile men, Winfrey thinks it’s something akin to critical mass.\\n\\n“It had been coming, it had been coming,” Winfrey said. “It had been coming with [Bill] Cosby and nothing happened, it had been coming with Bill O’Reilly, even with the President of the United States, where people can hear the Access Hollywood tape and yet, nothing happens. It had been coming and [Weinstein] was the moment was where it all crystallized.…In order for a phenomenon to be a phenomenon everything has to line up. It means the culture, the zeitgeist, for a particular moment in time to be ready, available and open to hear that message.”\\n\\nThe idea that these issues and women’s experiences with abuse and harassment have been building up in the culture for so long, with most women throughout history being unable to speak up because it would likely have meant further harm to them and their families, was what Winfrey was trying to get across in her acceptance speech at this year’s Golden Globes — not a political platform.\\n\\n“I wasn’t trying to run for any office,” Winfrey said of the speech. “I wanted to be able to say to the #MeToo movement, I’m proud of where we are and what we’re doing, but you need to know you didn’t get here alone. There are those who endured, suffered and didn’t speak because they couldn’t speak.”\\n\\nWinfrey slipped back into her role of interviewer and asked Paltrow if her decision to go public last fall with her own Weinstein story — wherein the producer got her as a relatively unestablished young actor to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and proceeded to unabashedly proposition her and then berate her for confiding in family and friends about the episode — was triggered by the then few other stories that had come out about him.\\n\\n“Very, and it’s been months of me trying to process through it all,” Paltrow, who worked with Weinstein several times after the incident, said. “It only happened one time and I confronted him and he never tried anything like that again, but he was [always] a bully about work things, he was shaming, he was really hard on me and then was incredibly generous and would send me a private plane somewhere. It was a kind of typical abusive relationship and I hadn’t processed it, because so much of my acting career and so many of the incredible highs and lows, as well, were associated with him and Miramax.”\\n\\nPaltrow added that the experience of going public has “brought up a lot of stuff lately” including abuse from her childhood, a topic that Winfrey spoke of her own experiences with during the podcast, and said she’s recently begun to question whether her decision to mostly leave acting when she had her first child was actually related to her experiences with Weinstein.\\n\\n“I always told myself the story that I’d lost the passion for it and then I had my daughter and I wanted to be home and now I’m starting to put the pieces together and thinking did this predominate relationship in my professional life lead me to not want to do it anymore?”\\n\\nWinfrey said that so many negative experiences with Weinstein “certainly had an influence” but also admitted that her hope for the #MeToo movement goes beyond women’s rights, and that it continues to facilitate what she and Paltrow agreed has become “a culture of enough.”\\n\\n“I’m hoping that it leads to a better way of all human beings treating each other and that this moment in the movement is leading to us toward saying, ‘Not only am I not going to take your sexual harassment, I’m not going to take any of your bulls–t.’ Period. I think we’re on our way but we’re still figuring it out.”   \n",

Prince Harry has finally proposed to his girlfriend Meghan Markle and the couple is set to tie the knot in the spring of 2018. \\n\\nSpeculations have been swirling for months that the couple was planning to get engaged, and today the news has finally been confirmed. The public has fallen in love with the American actress and her fashion sense, down-to-earth personality, and charitable works. The Royal Family, too, is reportedly ecstatic about the prospect of having such a \"modern\" bride.\\n\\nMany pundits have praised Prince Harry for choosing someone outside of the typical royal circles, and believe that Meghan Markle brings much-needed diversity to the monarchy. Markle is of mixed race, divorced, and a successful actress in her own right. Her engagement to Prince Harry is already being hailed as a critical moment in royal history.\\n\\nRumor has it that the wedding preparations are already underway, and that the couple is determined to make their big day a memorable one. There are already some reports that they plan to buck tradition when it comes to everything from the guest list to the style of dress. However, the Royal Family has been tight-lipped about any details.\\n\\nOne thing is for certain: the world will be watching as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle exchange their vows in spring 2018. The couple has already won the hearts of millions around the globe, and their wedding is shaping up to be a \"can't miss\" event. Stay tuned for more updates as the big day approaches!   \n",

However, the news of this installation has sparked outrage amongst their fans.\\n\\nMany fans have taken to social media to express their anger and disappointment in the couple's decision, claiming that it perpetuates a culture of fear and paranoia. \"It's ridiculous that they feel the need to have a panic room in their already secure and gated home,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"It's a slap in the face to those who don't even have basic safety provisions.\"\\n\\nOthers have called out the couple for prioritizing their own safety over the safety of their fans. \"Kim and Kanye have plenty of money and resources to keep themselves safe,\" another user tweeted. \"But what about the safety of their fans who support them and look up to them?\"\\n\\nDespite the backlash, Kim and Kanye remain firm in their decision and have emphasized that the panic room is a necessary precaution to ensure the safety of their family. However, it remains to be seen how this will affect their public image and relationship with their fans.   \n",

A source close to the situation reveals that Garner \"doesn't want\" her three kids with ex-husband Ben Affleck around his new girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus.\\n\\nThe source further disclosed that Garner has made her feelings towards Shookus very clear and has even gone so far as to ban her from coming near their kids. \"Jennifer has always been very protective of Violet, Seraphina and Samuel and she doesn't trust Lindsay around them,\" the source added.\\n\\nWhile Garner has not publicly commented on the matter, it's no secret that she and Affleck's relationship has been anything but amicable. Despite their split in 2015, the pair have remained co-parents, however, their relationship has been plagued with rumors of Affleck's cheating and addiction issues.\\n\\nGarner's recent action is sure to raise a stir in the media and among Affleck and Shookus' fans. However, the source emphasized that Garner was \"just being a protective mother and has nothing against Lindsay personally.\"\\n\\nAs the story continues to develop, it remains to be seen whether Affleck will take any action against Garner's decision or whether the couple will finally be able to work together for the sake of their children.   \n",

       "      <td>Warning: This story contains major spoilers from a recent episode of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit. Read at your own risk.\\n\\nRaúl Esparza has officially exited Law &amp; Order: SVU after six seasons. The actor joined the show in season 14 as Assistant District Attorney Rafael Barba in a recurring capacity before being promoted to series regular in season 15.\\n\\nIn a recent episode, Barba made the difficult decision to pull the plug on a brain-dead child, leading to his departure from the District Attorney's office. Although Esparza has left the series as a regular, there is a possibility for him to return in the future. Chicago Justice character Peter Stone, played by Philip Winchester, has now taken over as the new ADA and is expected to continue with the show if it gets renewed for another season.\\n\\nSVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin expressed his admiration for Esparza's performance, saying, \"The power, sensitivity, and morality he brought to the character of Rafael Barba never failed to elevate our scripts. Raúl is family, and we look forward to seeing his talent shine in new projects. As for Barba, SVU fans may see him again soon.\"\\n\\nWhile SVU has been on the air for 19 seasons, the show has not experienced much turnover in recent years. Esparza's exit marks a significant departure from the series, following the departures of other original cast members like Christopher Meloni, Richard Belzer, Dann Florek, and Danny Pino.\\n\\nFollowing his departure from SVU, Esparza will temporarily return to his Broadway roots for a Chess revival at the Kennedy Center. It remains unclear what projects he will take on after that.\\n\\nIn an interview, Esparza revealed that leaving SVU was his decision after six seasons. He explained, \"I had explored a lot of what I thought Barba was about, and I just felt it was time to move on. I was also feeling like the role has changed over the years in a way that has been an interesting experience for me.\"\\n\\nEsparza also expressed his fondness for his co-star Mariska Hargitay and his desire to work with her again, saying, \"Any opportunity to get back into a room with her is valuable to me.\"\\n\\nAlthough there were hints of a potential romance between Barba and Hargitay's character, Benson, Esparza believed that exploring their private lives would remove the excitement and allure of their relationship.\\n\\nEsparza shared that he felt satisfied with the development of his character, Barba, during his time on the show. However, he did mention that if a Barba spin-off were to explore the political world of the District Attorney's office, he would be interested in delving into that storyline.\\n\\nEsparza expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to work on SVU and praised the experience of working in television. He also mentioned his admiration for shows like The Crown and Game of Thrones, revealing his dream to appear on them in the future.\\n\\nFans of Law &amp; Order: SVU can catch the show on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner has confirmed that rapper Lil Peep died of an overdose of fentanyl and generic Xanax. The medical examiner ruled his death as accidental.\\n\\nAccording to TMZ, a mixture of other drugs was also found in Lil Peep's system. His blood tested positive for marijuana, cocaine, and the painkiller Tramadol, while his urine tested positive for those drugs as well as opiates like hydrocodone, generic Dilauded, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. However, no traces of alcohol were detected.\\n\\nLil Peep, born Gustav Åhr, passed away last month at the age of 21 in Tucson, Arizona, where he was scheduled to perform a concert in support of his debut album, \"Come Over When You’re Sober (Part One)\". Although local authorities initially considered his death to be \"suspicious,\" the Tucson police department had previously speculated that it resulted from a combination of Xanax and other drugs.\\n\\nAuthorities are currently investigating text messages sent by a woman who had visited Lil Peep's tour bus before his demise. Allegedly, one of the messages read, \"GBC [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol,\" while another supposedly stated, \"He passed the fuck out my brother called, and I tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up.\"\\n\\nRecently, a memorial was held in Long Beach, New York, to honor the rapper, known for his unique blend of hip-hop and guitar-driven emo. The memorial featured speakers and a public gathering.\\n\\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, Lil Peep had previously shared that he never took prescriptions for depression but enjoyed indulging in drugs. He stated, \"I just like smoking weed and whatever other drug comes my way. I don't like to pay for [drugs]. I just like to get them for free.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gwyneth Paltrow, Oprah Discuss Weinstein and #MeToo Movement's Future on Goop Podcast</td>\n",
       "      <td>Goop is kicking off its weekly podcast in a big way. Oprah Winfrey is Goop’s inaugural guest on its podcast, hosted by founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and the hour-plus conversation touches on everything Oprah, from her decades as an inimitable television host to her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her ultimate hope for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations, or lack thereof.\\n\\nWinfrey said she was friendly with Weinstein in a professional capacity from the days of her eponymous talk show, but addressed accusations that she must have known of his allegedly long history of sexually predatory behavior toward female actors and other women, saying she simply had no idea and wasn’t really in that world of entertainment. But she did know that everyone dreaded getting a call from him.\\n\\n“I was in Chicago, in my own little world, but what I knew about Harvey was that Harvey was a bully and that if Harvey’s on the phone, you didn’t want to take the call because you’re going to get bullied in some way,” Winfrey said.\\n\\nWhile for her a call from Weinstein generally meant being pressured, in a way left undefined, to have certain people on her show, now Winfrey is left wondering why she even let herself be bullied at all.\\n\\n“What I do question for myself is why I was willing to put up with a bullying thing?” Winfrey said. “I was willing to put up with, ‘OK I’ll take the call,’ ‘OK I’ll do that’…why am I willing to put up with an a–hole? Why we won’t tolerate other things, but you can throw phones and call people jerks or whatever and do all this nasty stuff.”\\n\\nAs for why Weinstein’s alleged behavior was a watershed for the long-normalized harassment and sexual abuse of women, despite many previous public allegations against not only Weinstein but other high-profile men, Winfrey thinks it’s something akin to critical mass.\\n\\n“It had been coming, it had been coming,” Winfrey said. “It had been coming with [Bill] Cosby and nothing happened, it had been coming with Bill O’Reilly, even with the President of the United States, where people can hear the Access Hollywood tape and yet, nothing happens. It had been coming and [Weinstein] was the moment was where it all crystallized.…In order for a phenomenon to be a phenomenon everything has to line up. It means the culture, the zeitgeist, for a particular moment in time to be ready, available and open to hear that message.”\\n\\nThe idea that these issues and women’s experiences with abuse and harassment have been building up in the culture for so long, with most women throughout history being unable to speak up because it would likely have meant further harm to them and their families, was what Winfrey was trying to get across in her acceptance speech at this year’s Golden Globes — not a political platform.\\n\\n“I wasn’t trying to run for any office,” Winfrey said of the speech. “I wanted to be able to say to the #MeToo movement, I’m proud of where we are and what we’re doing, but you need to know you didn’t get here alone. There are those who endured, suffered and didn’t speak because they couldn’t speak.”\\n\\nWinfrey slipped back into her role of interviewer and asked Paltrow if her decision to go public last fall with her own Weinstein story — wherein the producer got her as a relatively unestablished young actor to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and proceeded to unabashedly proposition her and then berate her for confiding in family and friends about the episode — was triggered by the then few other stories that had come out about him.\\n\\n“Very, and it’s been months of me trying to process through it all,” Paltrow, who worked with Weinstein several times after the incident, said. “It only happened one time and I confronted him and he never tried anything like that again, but he was [always] a bully about work things, he was shaming, he was really hard on me and then was incredibly generous and would send me a private plane somewhere. It was a kind of typical abusive relationship and I hadn’t processed it, because so much of my acting career and so many of the incredible highs and lows, as well, were associated with him and Miramax.”\\n\\nPaltrow added that the experience of going public has “brought up a lot of stuff lately” including abuse from her childhood, a topic that Winfrey spoke of her own experiences with during the podcast, and said she’s recently begun to question whether her decision to mostly leave acting when she had her first child was actually related to her experiences with Weinstein.\\n\\n“I always told myself the story that I’d lost the passion for it and then I had my daughter and I wanted to be home and now I’m starting to put the pieces together and thinking did this predominate relationship in my professional life lead me to not want to do it anymore?”\\n\\nWinfrey said that so many negative experiences with Weinstein “certainly had an influence” but also admitted that her hope for the #MeToo movement goes beyond women’s rights, and that it continues to facilitate what she and Paltrow agreed has become “a culture of enough.”\\n\\n“I’m hoping that it leads to a better way of all human beings treating each other and that this moment in the movement is leading to us toward saying, ‘Not only am I not going to take your sexual harassment, I’m not going to take any of your bulls–t.’ Period. I think we’re on our way but we’re still figuring it out.”</td>\n",

Read at your own risk.\\n\\nRaúl Esparza has officially exited Law & Order: SVU after six seasons. The actor joined the show in season 14 as Assistant District Attorney Rafael Barba in a recurring capacity before being promoted to series regular in season 15.\\n\\nIn a recent episode, Barba made the difficult decision to pull the plug on a brain-dead child, leading to his departure from the District Attorney's office. Although Esparza has left the series as a regular, there is a possibility for him to return in the future. Chicago Justice character Peter Stone, played by Philip Winchester, has now taken over as the new ADA and is expected to continue with the show if it gets renewed for another season.\\n\\nSVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin expressed his admiration for Esparza's performance, saying, \"The power, sensitivity, and morality he brought to the character of Rafael Barba never failed to elevate our scripts. Raúl is family, and we look forward to seeing his talent shine in new projects. As for Barba, SVU fans may see him again soon.\"\\n\\nWhile SVU has been on the air for 19 seasons, the show has not experienced much turnover in recent years. Esparza's exit marks a significant departure from the series, following the departures of other original cast members like Christopher Meloni, Richard Belzer, Dann Florek, and Danny Pino.\\n\\nFollowing his departure from SVU, Esparza will temporarily return to his Broadway roots for a Chess revival at the Kennedy Center. It remains unclear what projects he will take on after that.\\n\\nIn an interview, Esparza revealed that leaving SVU was his decision after six seasons. He explained, \"I had explored a lot of what I thought Barba was about, and I just felt it was time to move on. I was also feeling like the role has changed over the years in a way that has been an interesting experience for me.\"\\n\\nEsparza also expressed his fondness for his co-star Mariska Hargitay and his desire to work with her again, saying, \"Any opportunity to get back into a room with her is valuable to me.\"\\n\\nAlthough there were hints of a potential romance between Barba and Hargitay's character, Benson, Esparza believed that exploring their private lives would remove the excitement and allure of their relationship.\\n\\nEsparza shared that he felt satisfied with the development of his character, Barba, during his time on the show.

The medical examiner ruled his death as accidental.\\n\\nAccording to TMZ, a mixture of other drugs was also found in Lil Peep's system. His blood tested positive for marijuana, cocaine, and the painkiller Tramadol, while his urine tested positive for those drugs as well as opiates like hydrocodone, generic Dilauded, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. However, no traces of alcohol were detected.\\n\\nLil Peep, born Gustav Åhr, passed away last month at the age of 21 in Tucson, Arizona, where he was scheduled to perform a concert in support of his debut album, \"Come Over When You’re Sober (Part One)\". Although local authorities initially considered his death to be \"suspicious,\" the Tucson police department had previously speculated that it resulted from a combination of Xanax and other drugs.\\n\\nAuthorities are currently investigating text messages sent by a woman who had visited Lil Peep's tour bus before his demise. Allegedly, one of the messages read, \"GBC [Lil Peep] high af because of me and my friend lol,\" while another supposedly stated, \"He passed the fuck out my brother called, and I tried to get him to say hi to my brother but he wouldn’t wake up.\"\\n\\nRecently, a memorial was held in Long Beach, New York, to honor the rapper, known for his unique blend of hip-hop and guitar-driven emo. The memorial featured speakers and a public gathering.\\n\\nIn an interview with Pitchfork, Lil Peep had previously shared that he never took prescriptions for depression but enjoyed indulging in drugs. He stated, \"I just like smoking weed and whatever other drug comes my way. I don't like to pay for [drugs]. I just like to get them for free.\"   \n",
       "4  Goop is kicking off its weekly podcast in a big way. Oprah Winfrey is Goop’s inaugural guest on its podcast, hosted by founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and the hour-plus conversation touches on everything Oprah, from her decades as an inimitable television host to her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her ultimate hope for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations, or lack thereof.\\n\\nWinfrey said she was friendly with Weinstein in a professional capacity from the days of her eponymous talk show, but addressed accusations that she must have known of his allegedly long history of sexually predatory behavior toward female actors and other women, saying she simply had no idea and wasn’t really in that world of entertainment. But she did know that everyone dreaded getting a call from him.\\n\\n“I was in Chicago, in my own little world, but what I knew about Harvey was that Harvey was a bully and that if Harvey’s on the phone, you didn’t want to take the call because you’re going to get bullied in some way,” Winfrey said.\\n\\nWhile for her a call from Weinstein generally meant being pressured, in a way left undefined, to have certain people on her show, now Winfrey is left wondering why she even let herself be bullied at all.\\n\\n“What I do question for myself is why I was willing to put up with a bullying thing?” Winfrey said. “I was willing to put up with, ‘OK I’ll take the call,’ ‘OK I’ll do that’…why am I willing to put up with an a–hole? Why we won’t tolerate other things, but you can throw phones and call people jerks or whatever and do all this nasty stuff.”\\n\\nAs for why Weinstein’s alleged behavior was a watershed for the long-normalized harassment and sexual abuse of women, despite many previous public allegations against not only Weinstein but other high-profile men, Winfrey thinks it’s something akin to critical mass.\\n\\n“It had been coming, it had been coming,” Winfrey said. “It had been coming with [Bill] Cosby and nothing happened, it had been coming with Bill O’Reilly, even with the President of the United States, where people can hear the Access Hollywood tape and yet, nothing happens. It had been coming and [Weinstein] was the moment was where it all crystallized.…In order for a phenomenon to be a phenomenon everything has to line up. It means the culture, the zeitgeist, for a particular moment in time to be ready, available and open to hear that message.”\\n\\nThe idea that these issues and women’s experiences with abuse and harassment have been building up in the culture for so long, with most women throughout history being unable to speak up because it would likely have meant further harm to them and their families, was what Winfrey was trying to get across in her acceptance speech at this year’s Golden Globes — not a political platform.\\n\\n“I wasn’t trying to run for any office,” Winfrey said of the speech. “I wanted to be able to say to the #MeToo movement, I’m proud of where we are and what we’re doing, but you need to know you didn’t get here alone. There are those who endured, suffered and didn’t speak because they couldn’t speak.”\\n\\nWinfrey slipped back into her role of interviewer and asked Paltrow if her decision to go public last fall with her own Weinstein story — wherein the producer got her as a relatively unestablished young actor to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and proceeded to unabashedly proposition her and then berate her for confiding in family and friends about the episode — was triggered by the then few other stories that had come out about him.\\n\\n“Very, and it’s been months of me trying to process through it all,” Paltrow, who worked with Weinstein several times after the incident, said. “It only happened one time and I confronted him and he never tried anything like that again, but he was [always] a bully about work things, he was shaming, he was really hard on me and then was incredibly generous and would send me a private plane somewhere. It was a kind of typical abusive relationship and I hadn’t processed it, because so much of my acting career and so many of the incredible highs and lows, as well, were associated with him and Miramax.”\\n\\nPaltrow added that the experience of going public has “brought up a lot of stuff lately” including abuse from her childhood, a topic that Winfrey spoke of her own experiences with during the podcast, and said she’s recently begun to question whether her decision to mostly leave acting when she had her first child was actually related to her experiences with Weinstein.\\n\\n“I always told myself the story that I’d lost the passion for it and then I had my daughter and I wanted to be home and now I’m starting to put the pieces together and thinking did this predominate relationship in my professional life lead me to not want to do it anymore?”\\n\\nWinfrey said that so many negative experiences with Weinstein “certainly had an influence” but also admitted that her hope for the #MeToo movement goes beyond women’s rights, and that it continues to facilitate what she and Paltrow agreed has become “a culture of enough.”\\n\\n“I’m hoping that it leads to a better way of all human beings treating each other and that this moment in the movement is leading to us toward saying, ‘Not only am I not going to take your sexual harassment, I’m not going to take any of your bulls–t.’ Period. I think we’re on our way but we’re still figuring it out.”   \n",
